B: Electric potential causes the DNA duplex to unwind, leaving behind the cholesterol tether bound to the complement strand. C: Electric potential and the steady-state nature of the G-Quadruplex (GQ) causes it to unfold allowing the helicase to become enzymatically active in the 3’ -&gt; 5’ direction. D: As Hel308 translocates the DNA back up through the pore, the GQ will refold allowing an additional enzyme to become bound. E: Continued translocation. F: More than 3-4 abasic residues causes Hel308 to dissociate from the substrate (9 are used in the substrate). The DNA strand is then pulled back down and the cycle is able to repeat itself once more."

Bayesian power analysis can be used to estimate the number of samples we would need to reliably quantify a given effect size."

This became a nucleus of innovation, where the latest inventions were showcased and the most eccentric of ideas freely exchanged, injecting a palpable sense of excitement throughout the community.\nOur collective realization was stark: survival in this unforgiving land demanded that we become hunters. Yet, venturing into the shroud of night came with its own perilous gamble. The encroaching darkness was a canvas for an ever-expanding gallery of unspeakable terrors. Being the proverbial fifth wheel, I found my presence easily overlooked by my companions—a situation I begrudgingly understood. My role extended beyond mere reconnaissance of the shadowy world; I was tasked with learning how to better confront our adversaries in future encounters. However, woven into this duty was a far more macabre responsibility: should my comrades fall, I was to salvage as much of their gear as possible and bear it back to our settlement. Here’s to hoping for a smooth operation, though I’m keeping my expectations as dark as our surroundings.\n. . .\nMerely two days into our expedition, the universe decided to upend our expectations in the most batshit insane manner conceivable. A seismic jolt sent tremors through the earth beneath us before the ground itself burst open, catapulting us skywards on the back of a stone behemoth so vast, it seemed we had commandeered the very terrain. As we scrambled across its colossal spine, desperately seeking a secure foothold, a bizarre spectacle caught our eyes—a ghostly, diminutive creature with a stone face turned inside out, clutching what appeared to be carving tools.\nBy the time we maneuvered closer to the titan’s head, the peculiar artisan had vanished into the ether. However, our efforts were not in vain; we discovered four additional founding stones to bolster our collection. Surveying our surroundings from our lofty perch, we encountered faces chiseled into the stone with precision, juxtaposed against others eroded by the whims of harsh climates and, evidently, the movements of gargantuan, ambulatory mountains.\nBolstered by our initial triumph, we faced the White Lion with a confidence that was soon to be tested. Our comrade Ptolemy—whose ink still darkens your thumb from the time you wiped it from his eye, encountering the depth of another’s soul for the first time—suffered a brutal fate. In an act as swift as it was gruesome, his legs were cleaved from his torso, an unwelcome separation that spelled more than just physical parting. It became glaringly evident, even if by some miracle he had survived, that returning him home would be a feat beyond our reach. But his demise sealed a truth we all had grimly acknowledged: when one’s inner crimson tide ebbs away too far, they embark on a slumber from which there is no return.\nWhat mysteries might these eternal dreamers uncover? In a final act of fellowship, you kneel, clasping his hand for the last time, before steeling yourself for the return journey. “Rest in peace, brother. Your light will guide us through the ebony sea.”\n☠️ Ptolemy"

In what can only be described as a disastrously misguided endeavor, two members of the Settlement Intelligencia embarked on an act of intimacy with such catastrophic incompetence, it proved fatal. Perhaps the incessant screaming, which has plagued our nights for weeks, played its part. Investigating the calamity—and let’s be honest, tampering with the aftermath—led to a breakthrough: the discovery of Ammonia. This spurred the construction of The Leatherworker and prompted a heated debate over the mishaps of that initial encounter.\nAfter an intense discussion about what exactly went wrong with the first fucking, a second fucking commenced which was incredibly successful: yielding a pair of healthy twins. It seems, then, that even in the midst of folly, the seeds of hope can find fertile ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter hours of contemplation and vigorous debate, the settlement reached a unanimous decision. In no uncertain terms, we declared our disdain for mediocrity and fragility, embracing instead the ruthless doctrine of Survival of the Fittest. This path we chose is unforgiving; the young ones face a grueling trial by fire, with only the strongest emerging from the crucible of our community’s upbringing. Yet, it’s this very crucible that tempers them into beings capable of withstanding the desolate cruelty of the wasteland.\nBolstered by the promise of nurturing not just survivors, but warriors of unparalleled resilience—our very own cadre of elite, buff babies—our heroes ventured forth. Their target: a White Lion, a formidable beast that, under normal circumstances, would require a herculean effort to subdue. However, with their newfound confidence and strategic prowess, they dispatched the creature with such ease, it was as if they were merely swatting a fly, not battling a predator at the apex of its ferocity."

For one unfortunate scout caught gazing directly at the eldritch explosion, this transition became a permanent affliction. Among the others awakened by the phenomenon, one was battling insomnia by milling meal from collected vermin—a task interrupted as the sudden illumination seared his eyes, leaving him with lingering spots in his vision for weeks. Meanwhile, the village’s quirky chemist dashed outside, clutching a metal plate that had been innocuously lying near his workbench. Just moments before, it had been exposed to volatile cyanoplatinate analogues, a fact blissfully unknown to our local shaman who, despite his limitations, was doing his earnest best.\nClutched in his hands, the plate revealed a spectral, yet distinct, image of his own hand—sans skin, showcasing mostly the bony outlines. “I have seen my own death!” he proclaimed melodramatically [8].\nOur world, already no stranger to bizarre and calamitous surprises, watched as the residual light faded to near darkness, only to gradually regain its intensity. Far off in the distance, a vertical beam of erratic energy cleaved the night sky in two. At its zenith, the beam expanded into a spherical anomaly, periodically contorting and pulsating, casting ephemeral shadows against its luminous shell. Bracing for calamity, we were instead greeted with an unexpected boon.\nMiraculously, we found ourselves recipients of divine fortune—sacred lifetime rerolls transmuted into a gift of three robust newborns.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Holy light, homies. Let’s roll, baby!” the hunting party’s leader exclaimed with undue enthusiasm. Amidst a display of shadowboxing, complete with self-supplied sound effects, he led the charge, his phantom punches slicing the air [9]. The others followed without question. And why would they hesitate? Were you not paying attention? Buff Babies, that’s why. Get with the program.\nAs for the lion, well, the narrative took a swift turn. In the end, it became abundantly clear—he ought to have feared us."

Accompanied by a faint, metallic resonance, vibrations began to rhythmically pulse within our chests—a sinister harmony to the approaching beast’s cadence. The light, a dim lantern, swung intermittently behind the emerging silhouette that materialized through the mist. Paralyzed with dread, we could only watch as an immense, armored colossus lumbered toward our settlement. The stench of his approach hit us before his full form emerged into the dim glow. The dimness of his lantern raised questions, answers to which we would have been better off not knowing.\nThe Butcher had arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grotesque display of human faces stretched across his lantern left no room for doubt—this was no visit for diplomacy. Where ordinary survivors might have succumbed to fear, drenching their garments in terror, we conceived a cunning countermeasure. Positioned strategically at the battlefield’s edge, we sprang into action, inflicting three swift wounds with our newly crafted founding stones. Lured into a blind rage, The Butcher charged, his lethal maneuvers striking true only once before he collapsed onto the cold, barren ground.\nIncredibly, the blow that fell him separated The Butcher's Cleaver – usually welded in place – from his armored gauntlet and the settlement gained a powerful talisman to use against the coming darkness."

In the cold embrace of treachery, he murdered her, proceeding with a barbarism that chilled the very air: he devoured her skull. With ruthless determination, he crushed it against the stoic stone faces, breaking it into fragments small enough to be greedily consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst the shadows of this madness, one villager, whose path might have led to arson had there been much fodder to burn, observed a curious harmony between the fire’s glow and the whimsical wind coursing through the settlement. With ingenuity born of necessity, he crafted an airtight sack from scraps of hide and bone. Running with it aloft, he captured the wind’s essence, then, by compressing the sack beneath his arm while manipulating its opening, he directed a focused gust into the flames.\nThus, the forge was conceived.\nAnother, mesmerized by the hypnotic dance of the flames, dared the unthinkable. They plunged their hands into the scorching depths, holding the gaze of their horrified kin. Miraculously, their hands emerged, scorched yet imbued with a formidable essence, the enigmatic Hands of Heat. Bearing the marks of their ordeal, they radiated a perilous might.\nSteeled against the horror they had witnessed, with minds as unyielding as forged iron, the survivors faced down a White Lion with unwavering resolve.

Yet, they found themselves on the precipice of the unknown, facing adversaries not just of flesh and blood but of mind-bending absurdity and unfathomable insanity.\nWhispers of bizarre occurrences began to permeate the settlement. Initial reports were dismissed as the exaggerated tales of the overworked and sleep-deprived. They spoke of a cavalcade of eccentric figures prancing on the town’s outskirts, a sight so outlandish it strained credulity. Yet, nothing prepared them for the morning they awoke to find an enormous statue of a Lion Knight, its beauty marred by the grotesque addition of twelve-inch razor-sharp blades extending from each finger. The statue exuded an aura of unease so potent that none dared speak of harnessing its potential weaponry.\nSimultaneously, a more sinister presence haunted their periphery. Sightings of an inhumanly tall, gangly figure, its pallor stark against the dark backdrop of trees and buildings, began to accumulate. This specter, disappearing upon a second glance, earned whispers of Slenderman among the settlers, though such tales were quickly shushed in polite company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmidst this maelstrom of the bizarre, Galileo Figaro transformed into an entity unrecognizable, shedding his name and becoming a figure both known and unknowable to all.

His encounter with the lion—a brutal exchange that cost him his leg but also saw the lion’s hand severed—was deemed a bizarre yet fair trade.

The ephemeral spacetime scars left in the wake of this phenomenon had an unintended and devastating effect—a benign bacterial colony within a villager’s lung underwent a sudden and catastrophic mutation.\nThe settlement was plunged into a state of emergency as the infection spread, transforming mild coughs into severe respiratory distress. In an act of communal solidarity, the settlers donned makeshift masks, retreating into isolation in hopes of curbing the contagion.\nAmidst this turmoil, the settlement’s resilience was once again put to the test during a hunt that proved to be a pivotal moment for their survival. Emily Dickinson, a name synonymous with quiet introspection, emerged as an unlikely champion of the hunt. Her encounter with a particularly formidable White Lion—a beast that had long evaded capture—ended in a display of unparalleled ferocity. With a decisive strike, Emily severed the lion’s jaw, a symbolic act that resonated deeply within the hearts of the settlers."

As the earth beneath them convulsed with increasing ferocity, it became clear that this was no mere bout of indigestion but a portent of something far more profound. The couple’s home shook violently, casting shadows against the backdrop of a dense, emerald glow that pierced the darkness from beyond their walls [14]. This mysterious luminescence, an enigma wrapped in the night’s embrace, seemed to beckon, or perhaps warn, of a monumental event unfolding at the edge of their known world.\nCompelled by a mixture of fear, curiosity, and an unspoken duty to their community, the settlers deliberated on the source of this phenomenon. Propelled by a sense of foreboding, they considered the notion of “volunteers,” those among them who, driven by bravery or perhaps the promise of glory, would venture forth to uncover the truth behind the glow.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs fate would have it, the impact of the glowing crater heralded a period of unexpected abundance and vitality within the settlement. The charismatic Adam Smith, embodying both the vigor of youth and the wisdom of an elder, became the focal point of a remarkable event that saw the birth of three robust infants. These new lives, born into a world devoid of the constructs of nationhood or economic prosperity, represented a beacon of hope amidst the enveloping darkness. A celebration was inevitable, a moment of joyous reprieve in an existence marked by perpetual struggle.\n…And you wouldn’t be so rude as to fail to deliver an invitation to your settlement’s own patient guest of honor, would you?\nJoy turned to terror as the once inanimate statue of the Lion Knight sprung to life, its previous stillness giving way to a ferocious and unanticipated hostility. Amidst the chaos, Euler suffered grievous injuries, a testament to the unpredictability of their reality. Yet, in the face of overwhelming odds, Sir David Attenborough—recently knighted in recognition of his unparalleled contributions to the settlement—struck a decisive blow.

Shrouded in a cloak of translucent moths, he presented a sight both beautiful and unsettling, a living embodiment of transformation and transience.

    "text": "Foreword\n\nHow quiet the forest would be if only the most beautiful bird sang\n\nOne day as a young lad sailing the high seas of the early internet, I came across a comic that depicted a zany, bizarre, and humorous story about some dwarves who lived under the ground and suffered a series of misfortunes before all dying in some horrible way. I was immediately entranced and stunned to find out this story was based on video game, one with emergent gameplay which meant the incredible tale had not been explicitly hard-coded. It was from a game I was surprised I had never heard about called Dwarf Fortress\n“Surely this must be the greatest game ever made! I must immediately find and play it!”\n\n\n\n13 year old me: “What the fuck is this?”\n\n\nMy tiny child mind was too stupid to handle ASCII graphics so I never even attempted to play the game, but I never forgot how incredible it was to read about such a ludicrous adventure that somehow made me care about these dwarves being hurt or dying while doing whatever it is dwarves do. Mining and drinking mostly.\n20 years later, after a Kingdom Death campaign where I doodled some random pictures and notes from the campaign, I had the idea to take a set of more detailed notes for the next campaign and compile it into a short little summary to share with the others as a going away gift when they moved later this year. 2-3 pages tops.\nThen, in the middle of the campaign, I had the idea to use Midjourney, a text-to-image generation tool my wife had shown me, to make maybe 2-3 cool pictures I could include with the summary of the campaign. That would really step it up a notch.\nI ended up working on this, in some capacity, every day for almost three months. I got obsessed with new features in tools like Stable Diffusion, which offer much more control than commercial tools like Midjourney, and seemed to come out every day. As my friend joked, “Honey! New ControlNet just dropped!” I ended up spending hours each week making and learning about digital art. Hundreds of hours later I’m happy with the progress I’ve made and how much fun I’ve had doing things like mocking up one of my favorite guitarist’s Chaos Nurgle kitbash model: Section 1.2.4.\n\n\n\nAnd now for something, completely different\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrologue Warning\n\n\n\nThe prologue is written in a drastically different style from the rest of the work – which is still gruesome but humorous. By contrast, the prologue is inspired by one of my favorite hard sci-fi books Blindsight by Peter Watts, whose narrative style invokes confusion and uses abstract imagery.\nThe prologue can be skipped by jumping to Section 0.3"

Something… something feels wrong. Hands move instinctively – cautiously probing for the intrusion at the behest of one subroutine that, task complete, falls back among billions of writhing kin that labor within the emergent cathedral formed from an uncountable array of taut chromatic threads. They murmur indecipherably, weaving a Rorschach loom deep into the static hum of an endless sprawling labyrinth below. Hands clench in concert – knuckles forming in flight – and begin the labor of rubbing away the thick, pitch-like sap that blinds you from the world. The darkness shudders and a horizon ruptures forth – spilling uncalibrated brilliance onto a virgin charcoal canvas – as the first photons smash uncaringly into their hibernating lover’s perfect grasping hands, hewn by millennia to receive them. Black jaws squeal momentarily then snap shut to ward off the spreading incandescent rot. Hands return once more, their work unfinished. As the knuckles knead and grind, countless phosphenes spawn, dance vibrantly, and die. A horizontal crack tentatively forms anew, flutters briefly in resistance, and then opens…\n…to a sea of dark marble stone faces that extend out in all directions from the ashen and cracked ground below. Each face etched within the marble earth is unique, and your eyes lap greedily at the novel stimuli before the well quickly runs dry against a dark fading haze extending in all directions. Lethargic pulses and chaotic flickers of light sing out to one another from their perches within several dozen tarnished and heavy-looking lanterns that lie scattered haphazardly around you. Flames courageously slash and gouge impotent scars against the gloom’s surface before being quickly subsumed within its boundless polyphagic maw. The distant horizon bleeds pitifully into the twilight above. Glancing upward you subconsciously seek a constant engrained within the germ of your genetic lineage. You feel a deep pit of unease and confusion – It is not there. You lean forward – eyes strain their fibrous bridles, but find no purchase for the seam that separates one part of the formless space before you from another. Vertigo briefly sets in as your mind slowly begins to sink into the infinite sprawling vacuum. Discordance evokes a primal Stygian dread as sensory perception comes to conflict with that which is known.\nThe umbral space before you begins to st r e    t       c           h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low roar of an ocean fills your ears as the dull hammering beat of your heart grows louder, deafening you, stifling the chorus of pleas from reactive counter-measures as signal decays into a rising static tide. Glossolalia drips mercury-hot across your skin as the indiscernible cicadic chatter of a million voices rave the clarion call of the insane. Of Machin Shin, The Black Wind. The beckoning void reaches out to you, enveloping you, all-encompassing, all-consumi-\n\nMotion\n\n\nResponse      Potential         Engagement               Magnocellular Exultation\n\nA rapidly expanding undifferentiated web of light\n\n\nPerturbations in the periphery of your visual field scream out along ancient intention lines below to an older paranoid sibling who awakens with a slumbering roar, deafening the babble of the memetic death-spiral feedback loop within the cerebrum. The voices spiral out in chaotic gyres, growing dimmer as they lose coherence and scatter harmlessly upon the bone-dry wind.\nYour head snaps quickly to focus on this disturbance and you see others – like yourself – spread out in the murk, sitting up, looking around, rubbing dark ink from their eyes. A few huddle together, one helping another to his feet. Your meandering eyes halt abruptly – pools of dark ink sloshing quietly against another – as you stare directly into the eyes of one sitting away from the others and closer to you. His gaze narrows briefly but quickly relaxes upon seeing your open expression. A moment passes. Small pockets depress the contours of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a hesitant smile. Reflexively, your eyes move downwards in response, and, in transit, a saccadic mask deceives you and they arrive at their destination empty-handed. The lack of concordance between expectation and reality takes a fraction of a second to materialize.\nA thin dark liquid spurts in a double exposure across the fading face you had glimpsed. Time slows in unison with the fluid’s passage, which pauses briefly at the peak of its lazy parabolic arc, and turns with a sigh to await the fall. An abyssal seed soars unimpeded into this plane on eldritch wind, takes root, germinates, and begins to bloom deep within. Your chest heaves against its newfound prison, your breath becoming ragged and uneven. Hyperventilation sets in as consciousness attempts to parse the frantic, abstract imagery of the subconscious.\nThe headless torso slumps forward, slamming violently down – pinned crudely into the chiseled ground by an enormous human-like hand. Viscera oozes between the White Lion’s dexterous fingers – a simulacrum of rotten human fruit. He has come to feast. Muscles rippling, eyes glinting with dangerous intelligence, it pivots smoothly towards another, who had only just begun rubbing the ink from his eyes, deftly cradling one hand around its prey’s face, another enclosing still-rubbing arms, and with unnecessary glee, sharply jerks the head off. The White Lion stands on hind legs and bellows – delighting in the ecstasy afforded apex predators – and begins the slaughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour unconscious backpedaling meets temporary resistance as you stumble into three others – the same ones you had seen together earlier – who embrace you in their trembling bosom of arms and rags to cower behind a meager shield of inadequate cover among a few torso-sized boulders. A hollow serenity fills you as the gore and carnage of the beast become a mere visual and auditory display, safely compartmentalized from the screaming and panicked signaling of other neural systems.\nYou look at the others, who paint a shifting scene of anguish, panic, and despair. You turn instinctively towards the others and lock eyes – you have no language with which to comfort one another. But what comfort is there in certain death? One who had been rocking back and forth on the ground with their arms around their knees slowly rises to their feet clutching something with white-knuckled hands. She opens them stiffly to reveal a bloodied shard of stone, taken from one of the fractured stone faces beneath them where the lion had first announced his presence.\nHope in the face of hopelessness.\nYou lock eyes with the others and your steeled gazes cut the Gordian knot. The scope and profundity of the absurd reality before you clarifies. What choice is there but to fight? To cower before death’s gaze is to diminish the spirit – far better to look it in the eye and shout defiantly. For there is hope where there is courage. You and the other two quickly take to the ground, scrounging for similar tools with which to arm yourselves. As you stand you suddenly realize the shocking stillness of the quiet around you.\nNo others remain but you and your meager cohort. And the White Lion, of course. He sits patiently several stones’ throws away, as if waiting for you to wake from your reverie and acknowledge the reality of the situation before its termination. A cruel sadism that seems unnecessary for fitness – but perhaps prolonging execution constitutes a form of bootstrapping when training the networks responsible for hunting, stalking, and killing prey.\nThe lion stands, pauses for a moment to sniff the air cautiously, then charges.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine flood your body, causing muscles to tense, mouth to dry, eyes to dilate, and your mind to clear. The lion seems to slow as each breath becomes loud in your ears. As the lion prepares to pounce he is startled by your looks of calm resolve and stutters in an attempt to abort. A demented cackle cuts through the air – you are unsure whether you or your peers are the origin.\nYou and the others lift the shards above your head and scream as you sprint with abandon towards the confused beast. Enthralled with such bestial triumph there is no room for petty thoughts of mortality. There is only room for glory. Only room for victory.\nThe world is a series of flashes, screams, roars, pain, and rage as you and the three others mercilessly stab the White Lion as it backpedals, slashing impotently, unable to adequately defend itself on all sides.\nA woman, who holds no name as there is yet no language, seizes an opportunity as the lion limps weakly, blood leaking from myriad gashes and cuts in its flanks, and places the mortal blow. As the lion rears up on hind legs to bat away another attacker, the muscles in her arm ripple and time slows, the stone shard spinning end-over-end, until it collides with the lion’s groin – obliterating its genitals completely.\n\nAs the dust settles and quiet returns, you and the others shatter the stillness with elated bellows and sapien ululations, embracing one another, jumping and whooping with unrestrained joy. Together you proceed to harvest several juicy spherical bits from the lion, use your sharpened stones to crudely hack away his once prideful mane, and set off together in search of shelter. For if the White Lion could survive here – at least for a time – so could they.\nAfter an indeterminate period, you see a faint glow in the distance that continues to grow in the dark fog as your group moves closer. Emboldened – and without much choice – you proceed towards it and gasp along with the others when a towering stack of lanterns whose thin climbing peak seems to defy intuitive physics materializes out of the haze. Shapes move in the darkness and a familiar icy fear reaches up quickly to embrace you. But…\n…they are like you.\nThey pause cautiously and then notice your rags, shaking hands clutching shattered stone shards. One shouts excitedly to the others, rapidly joining together a series of confusing and challenging syllables, pointing to the lion’s mane wrapped around She-Who-Slayed-Him. The same one steps out towards the others slowly and lowers a much more impressively crafted bone knife to the ground and then raises his hands towards you. You look to the others, who imperceptibly nod, and you slowly bend to set your stone shards on the ground and begin awkwardly walking over together. As you step closer you see there are only six people in total and, as your eyes take in each unique face, the look of hope at your arrival is palpable. You are needed here.\nYou are welcome here.\n\nYou are home"

And I can write about pretty much anything and it looks like I’m diligently working.\nHeh, ok – maybe not so bad. Curator of the Historical Documents has a nice ring to it. Too bad that’s not my title and nobody will call me that, but hey – something to work towards. Goals! People are supposed to have those – right?\nWith so many weirdos brilliant minds about it’s not too surprising to see an exponential uptick in technological innovations. A Symposium to display new inventions and discuss outlandish ideas was built in the square beneath the looming Lantern Hoard, sparking much joy. As we set out on the year’s hunt to gather necessary resources, the ground erupted beneath us and we plunged into the sky on the back of an impossibly large stone beast – as if riding atop the very land itself. We scuttled along its lengthy back struggling to gain purchase and somewhere closer to the titan’s head we were struck by the sight of a ghastly pale miniscule creature with an inverted stone face – with what appeared to be carving tools in hand. Upon cresting the spine the creature was nowhere to be seen, but we did find 4 additional founding stones to add to our persons. Looking about we saw perfectly carves faces adjacent to a set cracked and weathered by the volatile weather and… well.. big moving mountains apparently.\nWe were confident from our first victory, but this White Lion did not go down without leaving his mark. Our dear Ptolemy – whose ink stills stains your thumb from the moment you rubbed it from his eye and beheld another human’s gaze for the first time – had his legs forcibly and – rather unpleasantly – separated from his torso. It is obvious even if he lived we would have struggled to bring him home, but this confirms what we had universally suspected – if enough of the red liquid inside someone becomes no-longer-inside-them, they take to a sleep they do not awaken from. What wonders await these eternal dreamers? You kneel and hold his hand one last time then turn and begin the journey home. Rest in peace brother – we will remember your flame when the darkness closes in.\n☠️ Ptolemy"

It’s been difficult to get a good night’s sleep in weeks – the screaming was difficult to ignore as sometimes it went on for what seemed like hours.\nFrom playing with investigating the bodies, we discovered Ammonia and used our resources to build The Leatherworker. After an intense discussion about what exactly went wrong with the first fucking, a second fucking commenced which was incredibly successful: yielding a pair of healthy twins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many hours of introspection and discussion the settlement comes to a consensus. We have decided that we are not about weak-ass wimpy bitch-babies and chose the hard-knock path of Survival of the Fittest – offspring are much less likely to make it through rearing within the settlement, but those that survive to adulthood are better prepared to endure the harshness of the waste. Armed with the confidence only foreknowledge of superior buff babies can bring, our heros set out and slew a White Lion while barely breaking a sweat."

A blinding flash turned the world to white. Permanently, for one unlucky scout who had been looking in the eldritch ordinance’s direction. A couple more had been awake: the first had insomnia and was grinding away the hours making meal from various vermin gathered and preserved over the years and he said everywhere became so bright so quickly that he didn’t have time to shield his eyes and had spots in his vision for weeks after. The second, the town’s eccentric chemist, ran outside carrying a hammered piece of metal that had been laying near his desk, which moments earlier had had a bottle of volatile cyanoplatinate analogues (unbeknownst of course to our town’s shaman, but he’s doing his best, can’t be too hard him). The plate held a ghostly yet distinguishable imprint of the chemist’s own hand. Without the skin. Mostly the outline of the bones to be precise.\n“I have seen my own death!” he shrieked melodramatically.\nThis world was obviously no stranger to deranged black swan events showing up willy-nilly and causing god knows what mayhem. The light had initially dimmed away, almost impossible to see, before slowly building in intensity until unknown leagues away a vertical shaft of chaotic energy split the sky in two. At whatever could be considered the “peak” of the line of light – it was hard to crane one’s neck far back enough to make out too much detail – one could see the light open up into a contained spherical shape, which would periodically writhe and pulse, leaving fading slashes of darkness against the glowing exterior. We prepared for the worst.\nHot damn! We are blessed! Blessed by holy lights in the sky! sacred lifetime rerolls were exchanged for a bounty of 3 beautiful buff babies!\n\n\n\n\n\n“Holy light homiieessss. Let’s roll baby!” yelled the overeager leader of the hunting party, who to be fair, was impressively pulling off a series of phantom karate moves against an invisible foe – complete with accompanied sound effects – all while maintaining a steady jog ahead of the other three. They didn’t mind. Why? Have… have you been reading? Buff Babies! Get your shit together.\nAnyway, back to the lion. Long story short: he should have been scared of us."

A faint metallic sound begin to build as the settlers felt resonance vibrations begin to rhythmically form in their chest. In concert with this beast’s footsteps no doubt. The pulse of the light was a dim lantern that periodically swung behind the bulk of the shape forming through the mist. We could only watch in horror as an enormous armored hulk sauntered towards their home. We could smell him before we could fully see his visage in the flickering light he held. Why was the light so dim? A question many wished had never been answered.\nThe Butcher had arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvident from the stretched caricature of human faces adorning the monster’s lantern, he was not here to parlay. Ordinary survivors may have wet their filthy rags – we on the other hand, hatched a devious plan. Starting in the corner of the open battlefield we sprang into action! – Swiftly dealing three wounds with our freshly carved founding stones. Baited into a blind fury, The Butcher ran towards us but his devastating movements only made contact a single time before he lay still upon the barren stone.\nIncredibly, the blow that fell him separated The Butcher's Cleaver – usually welded in place – from his armored gauntlet and the settlement gained a powerful talisman to use against the coming darkness."

Something about the statue was so unnerving that despite the theoretic ability to use the blades attached to the statue in some manner, it was topic that never made its way from thought to discourse.\nConcurrent with the other reports were utterances far more unsettling. People reported seeing an inhumanly tall, gangly, and stark pale figure standing partially behind a tree, bush, or corner of a building. Upon doing a double-take this apparition would vanish – a mere trick of the light? If the reports had not been collected independently, it would be nothing to worry about… Whispers of the Slenderman were heard, but never in polite company.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe… he’s so familiar.

Coughs turned to wheezes turned to water out the ass as the settlers quickly donned makeshift masks and hunkered in their respective enclaves to wait out the infection.\nThe hunt was a breeze thanks to Emily Dickinson, who showed the settlement was more than capable of taking on the more dangerous species of White Lion they had found existed a few years back. The lion was no match for the hunters’ ferocity and Emily cleaved the lion’s jaw from his face as she slay him."

His pompous and self-centered attitude had been grating on my nerves for far too long. But I tried to push those thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand.\nWe finally stumbled upon the Phoenix statue and, as if on cue, Lord Kelvin “accidentally” bumped into it, causing it to come to life. And then, out of nowhere, Steve Irwin appeared, slightly worse for wear. I couldn’t believe my eyes, but at least he was a welcome addition to our group.\nThe fight with the Phoenix was intense, and his vicious Razor Wind made it feel like we were in the middle of a tornado. But we managed to stay on our feet and fight back with all we had. After a grueling battle, we emerged victorious, with the Phoenix vanquished."

David Attenborough gained permanent priority and narrowly survived. Margaret Howe triggered the death blow allowing a high roll to get the Forsaken Mask letting us build the Mask Maker. Jane Goodall gained 2 twilight sword proficiency after inheriting the The Twilight Sword.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM\n\n\n\nA hush fell over the village as news of the Butcher’s return spread like wildfire. He was a formidable foe, a towering monstrosity with horns and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The mere mention of his name sent shivers down the spines of even the most hardened hunters. But we were not ones to back down from a challenge, no matter how daunting.\nDavid Attenborough, our resident naturalist, had been given permanent priority in recognition of his invaluable contributions to the community. Armed with a sharpened spear and his extensive knowledge of the Butcher’s behavior, he set out to face the beast head-on. The battle was intense and bloody, with David barely surviving several close encounters with the monster’s claws and teeth. But in the end, he emerged victorious, his spear buried deep in the Butcher’s heart.\nMeanwhile, Margaret Howe had triggered the death blow that allowed us to obtain the Forsaken Mask, a powerful relic that would enable us to construct the Mask Maker. It was a risky move, but Margaret had always been a gambler at heart. She had a knack for rolling high when it mattered most, and this time was no exception.\nAs for Jane Goodall, she had inherited the Twilight Sword, a legendary weapon that had been passed down through the generations. With it, she gained two proficiency levels in swordplay, becoming an even deadlier warrior than before. It was said that the sword had a will of its own, and that it chose its wielder based on some mysterious criteria known only to itself.\nBut even with these powerful tools at our disposal, we knew that the real battle was yet to come. The Butcher was just the first of many challenges we would face in our quest for survival. The future was uncertain, and the odds were against us. But we were a resilient people, and we would not be broken so easily. We would fight tooth and nail for every scrap of food, every drop of water, every inch of land. And in the end, we would emerge victorious, or die trying."

Leveraging the Quad Strike tactic, the fight started off quite well but Lion Knight’s incredible speed quickly became na issue. Even with a gloomperson and our savior Jane Goodall, Jane was sliced and diced until she bled to death. Gloomperson was MVP, avoiding almost all damage and then Sir David Attenborough shot his spicy Gloom-coated Arrow, blowing him to smithereens despite his single leg, broken other leg, and torn achilles tendon. Sir David became a bow master and margaret howe became a katar master. Full of optimism, they ventured out to fight the phoenix. A scary and treacherous fight, but they are triumphant once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM\n\n\n\nThe Lion Knight stood towering above the settlement, an imposing figure made all the more frightening by the way he seemed to materialize out of nowhere. It was a cold and foggy night, perfect for the Lion Knight’s theatrics. As the hunters approached, the statue came to life with a flourish of its cape and a flourish of its weapon, eager to do battle.\nThe first few strikes went well, as the hunters employed the “Quad Strike” tactic to great effect. But as the fight wore on, the Lion Knight’s incredible speed began to take its toll. Even with the help of the gloomperson and the formidable Jane Goodall, the hunters were starting to lose ground. And then, tragedy struck.\nJane was caught off guard and the Lion Knight’s sword sliced her open, leaving her to bleed out on the battlefield. The hunters rallied around her, but it seemed like all was lost. That is, until the gloomperson stepped up and became the MVP of the fight, avoiding almost all of the Lion Knight’s attacks and giving the hunters the opportunity they needed.\nAnd then, in a stroke of genius, Sir David Attenborough pulled out his spicy Gloom-coated Arrow and took aim at the Lion Knight’s single leg. The arrow hit true, and the Lion Knight tumbled to the ground with a sickening thud. With its other leg broken and its achilles tendon torn, the Lion Knight was no match for the hunters. Sir David Attenborough became a bow master that day, and Margaret Howe became a katar master, their skills honed in the heat of battle.\nBuoyed by their success, the hunters turned their attention to the phoenix. It was a treacherous fight, fraught with danger at every turn. But the hunters were triumphant once again, their optimism and determination seeing them through to victory.\nAs they returned to the settlement, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. They had faced down the Lion Knight and emerged victorious. They had battled the phoenix and lived to tell the tale. Who knew what other challenges awaited them in the years to come, but they were ready for anything."

Their faces were streaked with sweat and soot, their bodies battered and bruised from the relentless onslaught of the Gigalion. Hedy Lamar, the once-meek survivor who had transformed into a fierce warrior, was leading the charge. She held the Lion Knight’s claws aloft, the weapons still dripping with the blood of their defeated foe.\nCharles Darwin Attenborough, the settlement’s resident expert on all things biological and botanical, was grinning from ear to ear. “I told you, didn’t I?” he exclaimed. “I knew that Hedy was the one who could take down that beast!”\nHedy’s chest heaved with exertion, but she managed a small smile. “It was a close call,” she said, wiping the sweat from her brow. “But we did it. We really did it.”\nThe survivors had spent months preparing for this fight. They had crafted the finest armor and weapons, studied the Gigalion’s every move, and trained relentlessly to be able to take it down. And now, after a grueling battle, they had emerged victorious.\nBut the triumph was short-lived. As they made their way back to the settlement, they could see smoke rising in the distance. Their hearts sank as they realized that their home was under attack. They quickened their pace, their weapons at the ready.\nAs they approached, they saw that the settlement was under siege by a pack of snarling Goblins. The creatures were small, but they were fast and deadly. The survivors knew that they had to act quickly if they wanted to save their home.\nHedy led the charge, her Lion Knight claws flashing in the sunlight as she sliced through the Goblin ranks. Sir David Attenborough was right behind her, his bow singing as he picked off the creatures from a distance. Margaret Howe was close behind, her Katar blades flashing in the sunlight.\nThe battle was fierce and intense, but the survivors fought with a ferocity born of desperation. They knew that their lives and their home were on the line. And in the end, they emerged victorious once again.\nAs the last of the Goblins fell, the survivors took a moment to catch their breath. They looked around at the smoldering ruins of their settlement, and then at each other. They knew that they had been through hell and back, but they had come out stronger for it.\nAnd as they stood there, battered and bruised but unbowed, they knew that they were ready for whatever the world threw at them next."

Learning from this gristly premonition, the survivors plan better and sent out Margaret howe who proceeded to beat the shit out of him.

The return of Slenderman was not taken lightly by the survivors, and they knew they had to be prepared for the worst.\nThankfully, Margaret Howe was ready to take on the challenge. Armed with her katars and fierce determination, she charged headlong into the fight. Slenderman proved to be a formidable opponent, but Margaret was up to the task. She dodged his attempts to ensnare her and landed blow after blow with her deadly weapons.\nThe rest of the settlement watched in awe as Margaret expertly fought the terrifying creature. And when Slenderman attempted to ensnare her a second time, she was ready with two perfect lanterns, shattering his hold and leaving him vulnerable to her attacks.\nDespite a near-death experience for Milton Friedman Smith, who narrowly avoided death thanks to his quick reflexes, the survivors emerged victorious. Slenderman was vanquished, and the settlement was left with three precious dark waters as a reward for their efforts.\nBut they knew that this was only the beginning. With darkness still lurking just beyond the horizon, they would need to stay vigilant and continue to hone their skills if they hoped to survive. For in this world of death and danger, only the strong and the cunning will endure."

I think of BJJ as a loose physical analogue to chess which has several graph-based explorers. While chess explorers use directed acyclic graphs, BJJ is more intuitively modeled as a cyclic graph due to state repetition. For example, one representation defines nodes as positions and edges as transitions/moves.\nCan this representation aid our study of BJJ?\nI explored a few approaches: Drawing them on a tablet, Draw.io flowcharts, using Obsidian notes with links as directed edges, Excalidraw, and others…, but failed to meet some desired criteria:"

Unfortunately, this more formal definition tends to obfuscate things. Below is an example of Maintaining Full Mount with two edge types: dotted edges represent opponent movements and solid edges represent responses.\n\n\n\nFormal definition with nodes as static positions and edges as movements.\n\n\nThis definition is more tedious to generate given the myriad of side-variations that stem from a given canonical position.

    "text": "Subgraphs and The Library of Babelerimbolos\n\nThe library will endure; it is the universe     The Library of Babel\n\nMermaid provides several different node/edge/arrow types which can be used along with an alternative definition to make the graph more concise. One approach is to use subgraphs, which allow us to nest subsections of the graph, resulting in a denser output with fewer edges.\nIn this example, opponent moves are now represented as edges and our reaction are denoted by a separate node shape (rounded square). These reactions are nested within a respective subgraph that denotes the terminal position of the sequence.\n\n\n\nUse subgraphs for a denser representation\n\n\nThe other benefit of this approach is this graph now represents a potential modular component! A typical graph will likely have a left-most starting position and one or more possible terminal positions, such as our previous example with High Mount and Maintain Mount. But how are these separate graphs combined across Obsidian notes?\n\n\n\n\n\nRather considerate, thank you Xzibit\n\n\nObsidian’s Canvas allows any note to be inserted into a larger space which can then connect to other concepts into larger meta-graphs: representing anything from game plans to study areas. As more concepts are defined a “library” of ideas is built – each cleanly contained in their own note note, which when edited is conveniently propagated to any canvas referencing that note.\nBelow is a toy example where the previously defined subgraph previously defined is connected to some other possible concepts (which the author has lazily left undefined).\n\n\n\nBuilding a meta-graph in Obsidian’s Canvas\n\n\nIn addition to information retention – the goal of most note-taking – this approach should improve relating concepts learned at noncontiguous periods and assist in assembling systems that capitialize on curated experience."

Serendipitously, I moved last summer and on one of my runs I saw a BJJ gym was close by and convinced my wife to take a trial class. I was humbled by how difficult it was – and it hadn’t looked easy to begin with.\nBJJ is hard for me: I’m stubborn and hold bad grips, I have poor breath control, my lower ribs enjoy dislocating, and I’m over 30 which is borderline ancient for a combat sport.\nAnd yet… I really enjoy it. Aside from the challenge it forces me to prioritize my health and diet in order to train effectively. But most of my enjoyment stems from the generosity and kindness of the people I am fortunate enough to train with. I am grateful to them as this experience is a source of happiness in my life."

Something… something feels wrong. Hands move instinctively – cautiously probing for the intrusion at the behest of one subroutine that, task complete, falls back among billions of writhing kin that labor within the emergent cathedral formed from an uncountable array of taut chromatic threads. They murmur indecipherably, weaving a Rorschach loom deep into the static hum of an endless sprawling labyrinth below. Hands clench in concert – knuckles forming in flight – and begin the labor of rubbing away the thick, pitch-like sap that blinds you from the world. The darkness shudders and a horizon ruptures forth – spilling uncalibrated brilliance onto a virgin charcoal canvas – as the first photons smash uncaringly into their hibernating lover’s perfect grasping hands, hewn by millennia to receive them. Black jaws squeal momentarily then snap shut to ward off the spreading incandescent rot. Hands return once more, their work unfinished. As the knuckles knead and grind, countless phosphenes spawn, dance vibrantly, and die. A horizontal crack tentatively forms anew, flutters briefly in resistance, and then opens…\n…to a sea of dark marble stone faces that extend out in all directions from the ashen and cracked ground below. Each face etched within the marble earth is unique, and your eyes lap greedily at the novel stimuli before the well quickly runs dry against a dark fading haze extending in all directions. Lethargic pulses and chaotic flickers of light sing out to one another from their perches within several dozen tarnished and heavy-looking lanterns that lie scattered haphazardly around you. Flames courageously slash and gouge impotent scars against the gloom’s surface before being quickly subsumed within its boundless polyphagic maw. The distant horizon bleeds pitifully into the twilight above. Glancing upward you subconsciously seek a constant engrained within the germ of your genetic lineage. You feel a deep pit of unease and confusion – It is not there. You lean forward – eyes strain their fibrous bridles, but find no purchase for the seam that separates one part of the formless space before you from another. Vertigo briefly sets in as your mind slowly begins to sink into the infinite sprawling vacuum. Discordance evokes a primal Stygian dread as sensory perception comes to conflict with that which is known.\nThe umbral space before you begins to st r e    t       c           h \n\n\n\nThe low roar of an ocean fills your ears as the dull hammering beat of your heart grows louder, deafening you, stifling the chorus of pleas from reactive counter-measures as signal decays into a rising static tide. Glossolalia drips mercury-hot across your skin as the indiscernible cicadic chatter of a million voices rave the clarion call of the insane. Of Machin Shin, The Black Wind.

The voices spiral out in chaotic gyres, growing dimmer as they lose coherence and scatter harmlessly upon the bone-dry wind.\nYour head snaps quickly to focus on this disturbance and you see others – like yourself – spread out in the murk, sitting up, looking around, rubbing dark ink from their eyes. A few huddle together, one helping another to his feet. Your meandering eyes halt abruptly – pools of dark ink sloshing quietly against another – as you stare directly into the eyes of one sitting away from the others and closer to you. His gaze narrows briefly but quickly relaxes upon seeing your open expression. A moment passes. Small pockets depress the contours of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a hesitant smile. Reflexively, your eyes move downwards in response, and, in transit, a saccadic mask deceives you and they arrive at their destination empty-handed. The lack of concordance between expectation and reality takes a fraction of a second to materialize.\nA thin dark liquid spurts in a double exposure across the fading face you had glimpsed. Time slows in unison with the fluid’s passage, which pauses briefly at the peak of its lazy parabolic arc, and turns with a sigh to await the fall. An abyssal seed soars unimpeded into this plane on eldritch wind, takes root, germinates, and begins to bloom deep within. Your chest heaves against its newfound prison, your breath becoming ragged and uneven. Hyperventilation sets in as consciousness attempts to parse the frantic, abstract imagery of the subconscious.\nThe headless torso slumps forward, slamming violently down – pinned crudely into the chiseled ground by an enormous human-like hand. Viscera oozes between the White Lion’s dexterous fingers – a simulacrum of rotten human fruit. He has come to feast. Muscles rippling, eyes glinting with dangerous intelligence, it pivots smoothly towards another, who had only just begun rubbing the ink from his eyes, deftly cradling one hand around its prey’s face, another enclosing still-rubbing arms, and with unnecessary glee, sharply jerks the head off. The White Lion stands on hind legs and bellows – delighting in the ecstasy afforded apex predators – and begins the slaughter.\n\nYour unconscious backpedaling meets temporary resistance as you stumble into three others – the same ones you had seen together earlier – who embrace you in their trembling bosom of arms and rags to cower behind a meager shield of inadequate cover among a few torso-sized boulders. A hollow serenity fills you as the gore and carnage of the beast become a mere visual and auditory display, safely compartmentalized from the screaming and panicked signaling of other neural systems.\nYou look at the others, who paint a shifting scene of anguish, panic, and despair. You turn instinctively towards the others and lock eyes – you have no language with which to comfort one another. But what comfort is there in certain death? One who had been rocking back and forth on the ground with their arms around their knees slowly rises to their feet clutching something with white-knuckled hands. She opens them stiffly to reveal a bloodied shard of stone, taken from one of the fractured stone faces beneath them where the lion had first announced his presence.\nHope in the face of hopelessness.\nYou lock eyes with the others and your steeled gazes cut the Gordian knot. The scope and profundity of the absurd reality before you clarifies. What choice is there but to fight? To cower before death’s gaze is to diminish the spirit – far better to look it in the eye and shout defiantly. For there is hope where there is courage. You and the other two quickly take to the ground, scrounging for similar tools with which to arm yourselves. As you stand you suddenly realize the shocking stillness of the quiet around you.\nNo others remain but you and your meager cohort. And the White Lion, of course. He sits patiently several stones’ throws away, as if waiting for you to wake from your reverie and acknowledge the reality of the situation before its termination. A cruel sadism that seems unnecessary for fitness – but perhaps prolonging execution constitutes a form of bootstrapping when training the networks responsible for hunting, stalking, and killing prey.\nThe lion stands, pauses for a moment to sniff the air cautiously, then charges.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine flood your body, causing muscles to tense, mouth to dry, eyes to dilate, and your mind to clear. The lion seems to slow as each breath becomes loud in your ears. As the lion prepares to pounce he is startled by your looks of calm resolve and stutters in an attempt to abort. A demented cackle cuts through the air – you are unsure whether you or your peers are the origin.\nYou and the others lift the shards above your head and scream as you sprint with abandon towards the confused beast. Enthralled with such bestial triumph there is no room for petty thoughts of mortality. There is only room for glory. Only room for victory.\nThe world is a series of flashes, screams, roars, pain, and rage as you and the three others mercilessly stab the White Lion as it backpedals, slashing impotently, unable to adequately defend itself on all sides.\nA woman, who holds no name as there is yet no language, seizes an opportunity as the lion limps weakly, blood leaking from myriad gashes and cuts in its flanks, and places the mortal blow. As the lion rears up on hind legs to bat away another attacker, the muscles in her arm ripple and time slows, the stone shard spinning end-over-end, until it collides with the lion’s groin – obliterating its genitals completely.\n\nAs the dust settles and quiet returns, you and the others shatter the stillness with elated bellows and sapien ululations, embracing one another, jumping and whooping with unrestrained joy. Together you proceed to harvest several juicy spherical bits from the lion, use your sharpened stones to crudely hack away his once prideful mane, and set off together in search of shelter. For if the White Lion could survive here – at least for a time – so could they.\nAfter an indeterminate period, you see a faint glow in the distance that continues to grow in the dark fog as your group moves closer. Emboldened – and without much choice – you proceed towards it and gasp along with the others when a towering stack of lanterns whose thin climbing peak seems to defy intuitive physics materializes out of the haze. Shapes move in the darkness and a familiar icy fear reaches up quickly to embrace you. But…\n…they are like you.\nThey pause cautiously and then notice your rags, shaking hands clutching shattered stone shards. One shouts excitedly to the others, rapidly joining together a series of confusing and challenging syllables, pointing to the lion’s mane wrapped around She-Who-Slayed-Him. The same one steps out towards the others slowly and lowers a much more impressively crafted bone knife to the ground and then raises his hands towards you. You look to the others, who imperceptibly nod, and you slowly bend to set your stone shards on the ground and begin awkwardly walking over together. As you step closer you see there are only six people in total and, as your eyes take in each unique face, the look of hope at your arrival is palpable. You are needed here.\nYou are welcome here.\n\nYou are home\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyrightJohn Vivian - 2024 - All Rights Reserved"

Home Assistant (or hass) consolidates temperature sensors, motion detectors, cameras, computers, phones, and more into one extensible and configurable platform that can be run completely locked down on a local network away from the prying eyes of Jeff Bezos.\nI had been wanting to check out hass for a while after a good friend got me excited about it, but hadn’t wanted to shell out the money for a NUC. I realized I had a decent Windows Surface laying around from grad school that I wasn’t using and turned it into a server. As a masochistic exercise I forewent reformatting with linux (in case Surface-specific issues arose) and did everything in WSL2 – the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nPart 1 covers:"
