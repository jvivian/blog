Home Assistant (or hass) consolidates temperature sensors, motion detectors, cameras, computers, phones, and more into one extensible and configurable platform that can be run completely locked down on a local network away from the prying eyes of Jeff Bezos.\nI had been wanting to check out hass for a while after a good friend got me excited about it, but hadn’t wanted to shell out the money for a NUC. I realized I had a decent Windows Surface laying around from grad school that I wasn’t using and turned it into a server. As a masochistic exercise I forewent reformatting with linux (in case Surface-specific issues arose) and did everything in WSL2 – the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nPart 1 covers:"

    "section": "Foreword",
    "text": "Foreword\n\nHow quiet the forest would be if only the most beautiful bird sang\n\nOne day as a young lad sailing the high seas of the early internet, I came across a comic that depicted a zany, bizarre, and humorous story about some dwarves who lived under the ground and suffered a series of misfortunes before all dying in some horrible way. I was immediately entranced and stunned to find out this story was based on video game, one with emergent gameplay which meant the incredible tale had not been explicitly hard-coded. It was from a game I was surprised I had never heard about called Dwarf Fortress\n“Surely this must be the greatest game ever made! I must immediately find and play it!”\n\n\n\n13 year old me: “What the fuck is this?”\n\n\nMy tiny child mind was too stupid to handle ASCII graphics so I never even attempted to play the game, but I never forgot how incredible it was to read about such a ludicrous adventure that somehow made me care about these dwarves being hurt or dying while doing whatever it is dwarves do. Mining and drinking mostly.\n20 years later, after a Kingdom Death campaign where I doodled some random pictures and notes from the campaign, I had the idea to take a set of more detailed notes for the next campaign and compile it into a short little summary to share with the others as a going away gift when they moved later this year. 2-3 pages tops.\nThen, in the middle of the campaign, I had the idea to use Midjourney, a text-to-image generation tool my wife had shown me, to make maybe 2-3 cool pictures I could include with the summary of the campaign. That would really step it up a notch.\nI ended up working on this, in some capacity, every day for almost three months. I got obsessed with new features in tools like Stable Diffusion, which offer much more control than commercial tools like Midjourney, and seemed to come out every day. As my friend joked, “Honey! New ControlNet just dropped!” I ended up spending hours each week making and learning about digital art. Hundreds of hours later I’m happy with the progress I’ve made and how much fun I’ve had doing things like mocking up one of my favorite guitarist’s Chaos Nurgle kitbash model: Section 1.2.4.\n\n\n\nAnd now for something, completely different\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrologue Warning\n\n\n\nThe prologue is written in a drastically different style from the rest of the work – which is still gruesome but humorous. By contrast, the prologue is inspired by one of my favorite hard sci-fi books Blindsight by Peter Watts, whose narrative style invokes confusion and uses abstract imagery.\nThe prologue can be skipped by jumping to Section 0.3"

Something… something feels wrong. Hands move instinctively – cautiously probing for the intrusion at the behest of one subroutine that, task complete, falls back among billions of writhing kin that labor within the emergent cathedral formed from an uncountable array of taut chromatic threads. They murmur indecipherably, weaving a Rorschach loom deep into the static hum of an endless sprawling labyrinth below. Hands clench in concert – knuckles forming in flight – and begin the labor of rubbing away the thick, pitch-like sap that blinds you from the world. The darkness shudders and a horizon ruptures forth – spilling uncalibrated brilliance onto a virgin charcoal canvas – as the first photons smash uncaringly into their hibernating lover’s perfect grasping hands, hewn by millennia to receive them. Black jaws squeal momentarily then snap shut to ward off the spreading incandescent rot. Hands return once more, their work unfinished. As the knuckles knead and grind, countless phosphenes spawn, dance vibrantly, and die. A horizontal crack tentatively forms anew, flutters briefly in resistance, and then opens…\n…to a sea of dark marble stone faces that extend out in all directions from the ashen and cracked ground below. Each face etched within the marble earth is unique, and your eyes lap greedily at the novel stimuli before the well quickly runs dry against a dark fading haze extending in all directions. Lethargic pulses and chaotic flickers of light sing out to one another from their perches within several dozen tarnished and heavy-looking lanterns that lie scattered haphazardly around you. Flames courageously slash and gouge impotent scars against the gloom’s surface before being quickly subsumed within its boundless polyphagic maw. The distant horizon bleeds pitifully into the twilight above. Glancing upward you subconsciously seek a constant engrained within the germ of your genetic lineage. You feel a deep pit of unease and confusion – It is not there. You lean forward – eyes strain their fibrous bridles, but find no purchase for the seam that separates one part of the formless space before you from another. Vertigo briefly sets in as your mind slowly begins to sink into the infinite sprawling vacuum. Discordance evokes a primal Stygian dread as sensory perception comes to conflict with that which is known.\nThe umbral space before you begins to st r e    t       c           h \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low roar of an ocean fills your ears as the dull hammering beat of your heart grows louder, deafening you, stifling the chorus of pleas from reactive counter-measures as signal decays into a rising static tide. Glossolalia drips mercury-hot across your skin as the indiscernible cicadic chatter of a million voices rave the clarion call of the insane. Of Machin Shin, The Black Wind. The beckoning void reaches out to you, enveloping you, all-encompassing, all-consumi-\n\nMotion\n\n\nResponse      Potential         Engagement               Magnocellular Exultation\n\nA rapidly expanding undifferentiated web of light\n\n\nPerturbations in the periphery of your visual field scream out along ancient intention lines below to an older paranoid sibling who awakens with a slumbering roar, deafening the babble of the memetic death-spiral feedback loop within the cerebrum. The voices spiral out in chaotic gyres, growing dimmer as they lose coherence and scatter harmlessly upon the bone-dry wind.\nYour head snaps quickly to focus on this disturbance and you see others – like yourself – spread out in the murk, sitting up, looking around, rubbing dark ink from their eyes. A few huddle together, one helping another to his feet. Your meandering eyes halt abruptly – pools of dark ink sloshing quietly against another – as you stare directly into the eyes of one sitting away from the others and closer to you. His gaze narrows briefly but quickly relaxes upon seeing your open expression. A moment passes. Small pockets depress the contours of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a hesitant smile. Reflexively, your eyes move downwards in response, and, in transit, a saccadic mask deceives you and they arrive at their destination empty-handed. The lack of concordance between expectation and reality takes a fraction of a second to materialize.\nA thin dark liquid spurts in a double exposure across the fading face you had glimpsed. Time slows in unison with the fluid’s passage, which pauses briefly at the peak of its lazy parabolic arc, and turns with a sigh to await the fall. An abyssal seed soars unimpeded into this plane on eldritch wind, takes root, germinates, and begins to bloom deep within. Your chest heaves against its newfound prison, your breath becoming ragged and uneven. Hyperventilation sets in as consciousness attempts to parse the frantic, abstract imagery of the subconscious.\nThe headless torso slumps forward, slamming violently down – pinned crudely into the chiseled ground by an enormous human-like hand. Viscera oozes between the White Lion’s dexterous fingers – a simulacrum of rotten human fruit. He has come to feast. Muscles rippling, eyes glinting with dangerous intelligence, it pivots smoothly towards another, who had only just begun rubbing the ink from his eyes, deftly cradling one hand around its prey’s face, another enclosing still-rubbing arms, and with unnecessary glee, sharply jerks the head off. The White Lion stands on hind legs and bellows – delighting in the ecstasy afforded apex predators – and begins the slaughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour unconscious backpedaling meets temporary resistance as you stumble into three others – the same ones you had seen together earlier – who embrace you in their trembling bosom of arms and rags to cower behind a meager shield of inadequate cover among a few torso-sized boulders. A hollow serenity fills you as the gore and carnage of the beast become a mere visual and auditory display, safely compartmentalized from the screaming and panicked signaling of other neural systems.\nYou look at the others, who paint a shifting scene of anguish, panic, and despair. You turn instinctively towards the others and lock eyes – you have no language with which to comfort one another. But what comfort is there in certain death? One who had been rocking back and forth on the ground with their arms around their knees slowly rises to their feet clutching something with white-knuckled hands. She opens them stiffly to reveal a bloodied shard of stone, taken from one of the fractured stone faces beneath them where the lion had first announced his presence.\nHope in the face of hopelessness.\nYou lock eyes with the others and your steeled gazes cut the Gordian knot. The scope and profundity of the absurd reality before you clarifies. What choice is there but to fight? To cower before death’s gaze is to diminish the spirit – far better to look it in the eye and shout defiantly. For there is hope where there is courage. You and the other two quickly take to the ground, scrounging for similar tools with which to arm yourselves. As you stand you suddenly realize the shocking stillness of the quiet around you.\nNo others remain but you and your meager cohort. And the White Lion, of course. He sits patiently several stones’ throws away, as if waiting for you to wake from your reverie and acknowledge the reality of the situation before its termination. A cruel sadism that seems unnecessary for fitness – but perhaps prolonging execution constitutes a form of bootstrapping when training the networks responsible for hunting, stalking, and killing prey.\nThe lion stands, pauses for a moment to sniff the air cautiously, then charges.\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine flood your body, causing muscles to tense, mouth to dry, eyes to dilate, and your mind to clear. The lion seems to slow as each breath becomes loud in your ears. As the lion prepares to pounce he is startled by your looks of calm resolve and stutters in an attempt to abort. A demented cackle cuts through the air – you are unsure whether you or your peers are the origin.\nYou and the others lift the shards above your head and scream as you sprint with abandon towards the confused beast. Enthralled with such bestial triumph there is no room for petty thoughts of mortality. There is only room for glory. Only room for victory.\nThe world is a series of flashes, screams, roars, pain, and rage as you and the three others mercilessly stab the White Lion as it backpedals, slashing impotently, unable to adequately defend itself on all sides.\nA woman, who holds no name as there is yet no language, seizes an opportunity as the lion limps weakly, blood leaking from myriad gashes and cuts in its flanks, and places the mortal blow. As the lion rears up on hind legs to bat away another attacker, the muscles in her arm ripple and time slows, the stone shard spinning end-over-end, until it collides with the lion’s groin – obliterating its genitals completely.\n\nAs the dust settles and quiet returns, you and the others shatter the stillness with elated bellows and sapien ululations, embracing one another, jumping and whooping with unrestrained joy. Together you proceed to harvest several juicy spherical bits from the lion, use your sharpened stones to crudely hack away his once prideful mane, and set off together in search of shelter. For if the White Lion could survive here – at least for a time – so could they.\nAfter an indeterminate period, you see a faint glow in the distance that continues to grow in the dark fog as your group moves closer. Emboldened – and without much choice – you proceed towards it and gasp along with the others when a towering stack of lanterns whose thin climbing peak seems to defy intuitive physics materializes out of the haze. Shapes move in the darkness and a familiar icy fear reaches up quickly to embrace you. But…\n…they are like you.\nThey pause cautiously and then notice your rags, shaking hands clutching shattered stone shards. One shouts excitedly to the others, rapidly joining together a series of confusing and challenging syllables, pointing to the lion’s mane wrapped around She-Who-Slayed-Him. The same one steps out towards the others slowly and lowers a much more impressively crafted bone knife to the ground and then raises his hands towards you. You look to the others, who imperceptibly nod, and you slowly bend to set your stone shards on the ground and begin awkwardly walking over together. As you step closer you see there are only six people in total and, as your eyes take in each unique face, the look of hope at your arrival is palpable. You are needed here.\nYou are welcome here.\n\nYou are home"

And I can write about pretty much anything and it looks like I’m diligently working.\nHeh, ok – maybe not so bad. Curator of the Historical Documents has a nice ring to it. Too bad that’s not my title and nobody will call me that, but hey – something to work towards. Goals! People are supposed to have those – right?\nWith so many weirdos brilliant minds about it’s not too surprising to see an exponential uptick in technological innovations. A Symposium to display new inventions and discuss outlandish ideas was built in the square beneath the looming Lantern Hoard, sparking much joy. As we set out on the year’s hunt to gather necessary resources, the ground erupted beneath us and we plunged into the sky on the back of an impossibly large stone beast – as if riding atop the very land itself. We scuttled along its lengthy back struggling to gain purchase and somewhere closer to the titan’s head we were struck by the sight of a ghastly pale miniscule creature with an inverted stone face – with what appeared to be carving tools in hand. Upon cresting the spine the creature was nowhere to be seen, but we did find 4 additional founding stones to add to our persons. Looking about we saw perfectly carves faces adjacent to a set cracked and weathered by the volatile weather and… well.. big moving mountains apparently.\nWe were confident from our first victory, but this White Lion did not go down without leaving his mark. Our dear Ptolemy – whose ink stills stains your thumb from the moment you rubbed it from his eye and beheld another human’s gaze for the first time – had his legs forcibly and – rather unpleasantly – separated from his torso. It is obvious even if he lived we would have struggled to bring him home, but this confirms what we had universally suspected – if enough of the red liquid inside someone becomes no-longer-inside-them, they take to a sleep they do not awaken from. What wonders await these eternal dreamers? You kneel and hold his hand one last time then turn and begin the journey home. Rest in peace brother – we will remember your flame when the darkness closes in.\n☠️ Ptolemy"

It’s been difficult to get a good night’s sleep in weeks – the screaming was difficult to ignore as sometimes it went on for what seemed like hours.\nFrom playing with investigating the bodies, we discovered Ammonia and used our resources to build The Leatherworker. After an intense discussion about what exactly went wrong with the first fucking, a second fucking commenced which was incredibly successful: yielding a pair of healthy twins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter many hours of introspection and discussion the settlement comes to a consensus. We have decided that we are not about weak-ass wimpy bitch-babies and chose the hard-knock path of Survival of the Fittest – offspring are much less likely to make it through rearing within the settlement, but those that survive to adulthood are better prepared to endure the harshness of the waste. Armed with the confidence only foreknowledge of superior buff babies can bring, our heros set out and slew a White Lion while barely breaking a sweat."

Carried from a distance, Shot to me,  Flowing through me, Flashing before me,  Violent, Convulsing, Bright  I was haggard but unworn,  I was youthful but bitter,  I was ignorant, I was worldly,  I was shown into a lifetime’s experiences\n\nNight became day. A blinding flash turned the world to white. Permanently, for one unlucky scout who had been looking in the eldritch ordinance’s direction. A couple more had been awake: the first had insomnia and was grinding away the hours making meal from various vermin gathered and preserved over the years and he said everywhere became so bright so quickly that he didn’t have time to shield his eyes and had spots in his vision for weeks after. The second, the town’s eccentric chemist, ran outside carrying a hammered piece of metal that had been laying near his desk, which moments earlier had had a bottle of volatile cyanoplatinate analogues (unbeknownst of course to our town’s shaman, but he’s doing his best, can’t be too hard him). The plate held a ghostly yet distinguishable imprint of the chemist’s own hand. Without the skin. Mostly the outline of the bones to be precise.\n“I have seen my own death!” he shrieked melodramatically.\nThis world was obviously no stranger to deranged black swan events showing up willy-nilly and causing god knows what mayhem. The light had initially dimmed away, almost impossible to see, before slowly building in intensity until unknown leagues away a vertical shaft of chaotic energy split the sky in two. At whatever could be considered the “peak” of the line of light – it was hard to crane one’s neck far back enough to make out too much detail – one could see the light open up into a contained spherical shape, which would periodically writhe and pulse, leaving fading slashes of darkness against the glowing exterior. We prepared for the worst.\nHot damn! We are blessed! Blessed by holy lights in the sky! sacred lifetime rerolls were exchanged for a bounty of 3 beautiful buff babies!\n\n\n\n\n\n“Holy light homiieessss. Let’s roll baby!” yelled the overeager leader of the hunting party, who to be fair, was impressively pulling off a series of phantom karate moves against an invisible foe – complete with accompanied sound effects – all while maintaining a steady jog ahead of the other three. They didn’t mind. Why? Have… have you been reading? Buff Babies! Get your shit together.\nAnyway, back to the lion. Long story short: he should have been scared of us."

A faint metallic sound begin to build as the settlers felt resonance vibrations begin to rhythmically form in their chest. In concert with this beast’s footsteps no doubt. The pulse of the light was a dim lantern that periodically swung behind the bulk of the shape forming through the mist. We could only watch in horror as an enormous armored hulk sauntered towards their home. We could smell him before we could fully see his visage in the flickering light he held. Why was the light so dim? A question many wished had never been answered.\nThe Butcher had arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvident from the stretched caricature of human faces adorning the monster’s lantern, he was not here to parlay. Ordinary survivors may have wet their filthy rags – we on the other hand, hatched a devious plan. Starting in the corner of the open battlefield we sprang into action! – Swiftly dealing three wounds with our freshly carved founding stones. Baited into a blind fury, The Butcher ran towards us but his devastating movements only made contact a single time before he lay still upon the barren stone.\nIncredibly, the blow that fell him separated The Butcher's Cleaver – usually welded in place – from his armored gauntlet and the settlement gained a powerful talisman to use against the coming darkness."

Using some tattered strips of hide and bone scraps he formed an air proof sack he could run holding above his head and swing down to trap the air.

But… Absurdity? Insanity? These were novel frontiers to conquer. First, reports of a prancing band of weirdos on the outskirts of town are heard before one morning an enormous statue of a – one might say oddly handsome Lion Knight with beautiful hair – except for the fact that from each finger extended a 12” razor sharp blade. Something about the statue was so unnerving that despite the theoretic ability to use the blades attached to the statue in some manner, it was topic that never made its way from thought to discourse.\nConcurrent with the other reports were utterances far more unsettling. People reported seeing an inhumanly tall, gangly, and stark pale figure standing partially behind a tree, bush, or corner of a building. Upon doing a double-take this apparition would vanish – a mere trick of the light? If the reports had not been collected independently, it would be nothing to worry about… Whispers of the Slenderman were heard, but never in polite company.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe… he’s so familiar.

The granularity of the effects were not noticed immediately, but the spacetime scars that had appeared briefly in the settlement had the incredibly unfortunate effect of transposing a highly effective growth gene into a benign bacterial colony in the left lower lung of one villager. Coughs turned to wheezes turned to water out the ass as the settlers quickly donned makeshift masks and hunkered in their respective enclaves to wait out the infection.\nThe hunt was a breeze thanks to Emily Dickinson, who showed the settlement was more than capable of taking on the more dangerous species of White Lion they had found existed a few years back. The lion was no match for the hunters’ ferocity and Emily cleaved the lion’s jaw from his face as she slay him."

Hedy lamar won the foot race, willa cather won the debate contest, and fight contest, and charles sucks at fighting and got his arm cut off like an idiot. Unfortunately, an eerie presence has returned… the slenderman’s terrifying visage threatens the settlement once more. He murdered 4 people. Thankfully it was all just a bad dream. Learning from this gristly premonition, the survivors plan better and sent out Margaret howe who proceeded to beat the shit out of him. Slenderman attempted to ensnare twice but was met with two perfect lanterns. Milton Friedman Smith narrowly escaped death by rolling to perfect lanterns on their trauma roll. Hit the death blow and left with 3 dark water!"

Tools like stable diffusion allow me to combine visual art with the other thing in life I truly enjoy: swearing at the computer and package dependency hell.\nI think of an interview many years ago with Hans Zimmer that surprised me. He said he wasn’t really “fluent” in any particular instrument and that he is appreciative music made its way onto computers or he would never have had the opportunity to explore a passion that brings him and many others so much joy.\n\n\n\nMany illustrations are derived directly from the Kingdom Death miniatures themselves.
