<p>How quiet the forest would be<br> if only the most beautiful bird sang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day as a young lad sailing the high seas of the early internet, I came across a comic that depicted a zany, bizarre, and humorous story about some dwarves who lived under the ground and suffered a series of misfortunes before all dying in some horrible way. I was immediately entranced and stunned to find out this story was based on video game, one with <em>emergent gameplay</em> which meant the incredible tale had not been explicitly hard-coded. It was from a game I was surprised I had never heard about called <code>Dwarf Fortress</code></p>
<p>“Surely this must be the greatest game ever made! I must immediately find and play it!”</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><a href="imgs/dorfs.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="13 year old me: “What the fuck is this?”"><img src="imgs/dorfs.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></a></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">13 year old me: “What the fuck is this?”</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>My tiny child mind was too stupid to handle ASCII graphics so I never even attempted to play the game, but I never forgot how incredible it was to read about such a ludicrous adventure that somehow made me care about these dwarves being hurt or dying while doing whatever it is dwarves do. Mining and drinking mostly.</p>
<p>20 years later, after a <a href="https://kingdomdeath.com/">Kingdom Death</a> campaign where I doodled some random pictures and notes from the campaign, I had the idea to take a set of more detailed notes for the next campaign and compile it into a short little summary to share with the others as a going away gift when they moved later this year. 2-3 pages tops.</p>
<p>Then, in the middle of the campaign, I had the idea to use Midjourney, a text-to-image generation tool my wife had shown me, to make maybe 2-3 cool pictures I could include with the summary of the campaign. That would really step it up a notch.</p>
<p>I ended up working on this, in some capacity, every day for almost three months. I got obsessed with new features in tools like Stable Diffusion, which offer much more control than commercial tools like Midjourney, and seemed to come out every day. As my friend joked, “Honey! New ControlNet just dropped!” I ended up spending hours each week making and learning about digital art. Hundreds of hours later I’m happy with the progress I’ve made and how much fun I’ve had doing things like mocking up one of my favorite guitarist’s Chaos Nurgle kitbash model: <a href="#sec-mp-nurg">Section&nbsp;1.2.4</a>.</p>

Prologue Warning
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The prologue is written in a drastically different style from the rest of the work – which is still gruesome but humorous. By contrast, the prologue is inspired by one of my favorite hard sci-fi books <em>Blindsight</em> by Peter Watts, whose narrative style invokes confusion and uses abstract imagery.</p>

<p>…and prop yourself up on the hard, damp surface beneath you. Something… something <em>feels</em> wrong. Hands move instinctively – cautiously probing for the intrusion at the behest of one subroutine that, task complete, falls back among billions of writhing kin that labor within the emergent cathedral formed from an uncountable array of taut chromatic threads. They murmur indecipherably, weaving a Rorschach loom deep into the static hum of an endless sprawling labyrinth below. Hands clench in concert – knuckles forming in flight – and begin the labor of rubbing away the thick, pitch-like sap that blinds you from the world. The darkness shudders and a horizon ruptures forth – spilling uncalibrated brilliance onto a virgin charcoal canvas – as the first photons smash uncaringly into their hibernating lover’s perfect grasping hands, hewn by millennia to receive them. Black jaws squeal momentarily then snap shut to ward off the spreading incandescent rot. Hands return once more, their work unfinished. As the knuckles knead and grind, countless phosphenes spawn, dance vibrantly, and die. A horizontal crack tentatively forms anew, flutters briefly in resistance, and then <em>opens</em>…</p>
<p>…to a sea of dark marble stone faces that extend out in all directions from the ashen and cracked ground below. Each face etched within the marble earth is unique, and your eyes lap greedily at the novel stimuli before the well quickly runs dry against a dark fading haze extending in all directions. Lethargic pulses and chaotic flickers of light sing out to one another from their perches within several dozen tarnished and heavy-looking lanterns that lie scattered haphazardly around you. Flames courageously slash and gouge impotent scars against the gloom’s surface before being quickly subsumed within its boundless polyphagic maw. The distant horizon bleeds pitifully into the twilight above. Glancing upward you subconsciously seek a constant engrained within the germ of your genetic lineage. You feel a deep pit of unease and confusion – <em>It is not there</em>. You lean forward – eyes strain their fibrous bridles, but find no purchase for the seam that separates one part of the formless space before you from another. Vertigo briefly sets in as your mind slowly begins to sink into the infinite sprawling vacuum. Discordance evokes a primal Stygian dread as sensory perception comes to conflict with <em>that which is known</em>.</p>
<p>The umbral space before you begins to st r <em>e &nbsp; &nbsp;t &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h</em> <br></p>

<p>The low roar of an ocean fills your ears as the dull hammering beat of your heart grows louder, deafening you, stifling the chorus of pleas from reactive counter-measures as signal decays into a rising static tide. Glossolalia drips mercury-hot across your skin as the indiscernible cicadic chatter of a million voices rave the clarion call of the insane. Of <em>Machin Shin</em>, The Black Wind. The beckoning void reaches out to you, enveloping you, all-encompassing, all-consumi-<br><br><br></p>

<p>Perturbations in the periphery of your visual field scream out along ancient intention lines below to an older paranoid sibling who awakens with a slumbering roar, deafening the babble of the memetic death-spiral feedback loop within the cerebrum. The voices spiral out in chaotic gyres, growing dimmer as they lose coherence and scatter harmlessly upon the bone-dry wind.</p>
<p>Your head snaps quickly to focus on this disturbance and you see others – like yourself – spread out in the murk, sitting up, looking around, rubbing dark ink from their eyes. A few huddle together, one helping another to his feet. Your meandering eyes halt abruptly – pools of dark ink sloshing quietly against another – as you stare directly into the eyes of one sitting away from the others and closer to you. His gaze narrows briefly but quickly relaxes upon seeing your open expression. A moment passes. Small pockets depress the contours of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a hesitant smile. Reflexively, your eyes move downwards in response, and, in transit, a saccadic mask deceives you and they arrive at their destination empty-handed. The lack of concordance between expectation and reality takes a fraction of a second to materialize.</p>
<p>A thin dark liquid spurts in a double exposure across the fading face you had glimpsed. Time slows in unison with the fluid’s passage, which pauses briefly at the peak of its lazy parabolic arc, and turns with a sigh to await the fall. An abyssal seed soars unimpeded into this plane on eldritch wind, takes root, germinates, and begins to bloom deep within. Your chest heaves against its newfound prison, your breath becoming ragged and uneven. Hyperventilation sets in as consciousness attempts to parse the frantic, abstract imagery of the subconscious.</p>
<p>The headless torso slumps forward, slamming violently down – pinned crudely into the chiseled ground by an enormous <em>human-like</em> hand. Viscera oozes between the White Lion’s dexterous fingers – a simulacrum of rotten human fruit. He has come to feast. Muscles rippling, eyes glinting with dangerous intelligence, it pivots smoothly towards another, who had only just begun rubbing the ink from his eyes, deftly cradling one hand around its prey’s face, another enclosing still-rubbing arms, and with unnecessary glee, sharply jerks the head off. The White Lion stands on hind legs and bellows – delighting in the ecstasy afforded apex predators – and begins the slaughter.</p>

</div>
<p>Your unconscious backpedaling meets temporary resistance as you stumble into three others – the same ones you had seen together earlier – who embrace you in their trembling bosom of arms and rags to cower behind a meager shield of inadequate cover among a few torso-sized boulders. A hollow serenity fills you as the gore and carnage of the beast become a mere visual and auditory display, safely compartmentalized from the screaming and panicked signaling of other neural systems.</p>
<p>You look at the others, who paint a shifting scene of anguish, panic, and despair. You turn instinctively towards the others and lock eyes – you have no language with which to comfort one another. But what comfort is there in certain death? One who had been rocking back and forth on the ground with their arms around their knees slowly rises to their feet clutching something with white-knuckled hands. She opens them stiffly to reveal a bloodied shard of stone, taken from one of the fractured stone faces beneath them where the lion had first announced his presence.</p>
<p>Hope in the face of hopelessness.</p>
<p>You lock eyes with the others and your steeled gazes cut the Gordian knot. The scope and profundity of the absurd reality before you clarifies. What choice is there but to fight? To cower before death’s gaze is to diminish the spirit – far better to look it in the eye and shout defiantly. For there is hope where there is courage. You and the other two quickly take to the ground, scrounging for similar tools with which to arm yourselves. As you stand you suddenly realize the shocking stillness of the quiet around you.</p>
<p>No others remain but you and your meager cohort. And the White Lion, of course. He sits patiently several stones’ throws away, as if waiting for you to wake from your reverie and acknowledge the reality of the situation before its termination. A cruel sadism that seems unnecessary for fitness – but perhaps prolonging execution constitutes a form of bootstrapping when training the networks responsible for hunting, stalking, and killing prey.</p>
<p>The lion stands, pauses for a moment to sniff the air cautiously, then charges.</p>
<p>Epinephrine and norepinephrine flood your body, causing muscles to tense, mouth to dry, eyes to dilate, and your mind to clear. The lion seems to slow as each breath becomes loud in your ears. As the lion prepares to pounce he is startled by your looks of calm resolve and stutters in an attempt to abort. A demented cackle cuts through the air – you are unsure whether you or your peers are the origin.</p>
<p>You and the others lift the shards above your head and scream as you sprint with abandon towards the confused beast. Enthralled with such bestial triumph there is no room for petty thoughts of mortality. There is only room for glory. Only room for victory.</p>
<p>The world is a series of flashes, screams, roars, pain, and rage as you and the three others mercilessly stab the White Lion as it backpedals, slashing impotently, unable to adequately defend itself on all sides.</p>
<p>A woman, who holds no name as there is yet no language, seizes an opportunity as the lion limps weakly, blood leaking from myriad gashes and cuts in its flanks, and places the mortal blow. As the lion rears up on hind legs to bat away another attacker, the muscles in her arm ripple and time slows, the stone shard spinning end-over-end, until it collides with the lion’s groin – obliterating its genitals completely.</p>
<hr>
<p>As the dust settles and quiet returns, you and the others shatter the stillness with elated bellows and sapien ululations, embracing one another, jumping and whooping with unrestrained joy. Together you proceed to harvest several juicy spherical bits from the lion, use your sharpened stones to crudely hack away his once prideful mane, and set off together in search of shelter. For if the White Lion could survive here – at least for a time – so could they.</p>
<p>After an indeterminate period, you see a faint glow in the distance that continues to grow in the dark fog as your group moves closer. Emboldened – and without much choice – you proceed towards it and gasp along with the others when a towering stack of lanterns whose thin climbing peak seems to defy intuitive physics materializes out of the haze. Shapes move in the darkness and a familiar icy fear reaches up quickly to embrace you. But…</p>
<p>…they are like you.</p>
<p>They pause cautiously and then notice your rags, shaking hands clutching shattered stone shards. One shouts excitedly to the others, rapidly joining together a series of confusing and challenging syllables, pointing to the lion’s mane wrapped around <em>She-Who-Slayed-Him</em>. The same one steps out towards the others slowly and lowers a much more impressively crafted bone knife to the ground and then raises his hands towards you. You look to the others, who imperceptibly nod, and you slowly bend to set your stone shards on the ground and begin awkwardly walking over together. As you step closer you see there are only six people in total and, as your eyes take in each unique face, the look of hope at your arrival is palpable. You are needed here.</p>

<p>Well, it’s not the <em>worst</em> job in the settlement. And I can write about pretty much anything and it looks like I’m diligently working.</p>
<p>Heh, ok – maybe not so bad. <em>Curator of the Historical Documents</em> has a nice ring to it. Too bad that’s not my title and nobody will call me that, but hey – something to work towards. Goals! People are supposed to have those – right?</p>
<p>With so many <del>weirdos</del> brilliant minds about it’s not too surprising to see an exponential uptick in technological innovations. A <code>Symposium</code> to display new inventions and discuss outlandish ideas was built in the square beneath the looming <code>Lantern Hoard</code>, sparking much joy. As we set out on the year’s hunt to gather necessary resources, the ground erupted beneath us and we plunged into the sky on the back of an impossibly large stone beast – as if riding atop the very land itself. We scuttled along its lengthy back struggling to gain purchase and somewhere closer to the titan’s head we were struck by the sight of a ghastly pale miniscule creature with an inverted stone face – with what appeared to be carving tools in hand. Upon cresting the spine the creature was nowhere to be seen, but we did find 4 additional founding stones to add to our persons. Looking about we saw perfectly carves faces adjacent to a set cracked and weathered by the volatile weather and… well.. big moving mountains apparently.</p>
<p>We were confident from our first victory, but this <code>White Lion</code> did not go down without leaving his mark. Our dear <strong>Ptolemy</strong> – whose ink stills stains your thumb from the moment you rubbed it from his eye and beheld another human’s gaze for the first time – had his legs forcibly and – rather unpleasantly – separated from his torso. It is obvious even if he lived we would have struggled to bring him home, but this confirms what we had universally suspected – if enough of the red liquid inside someone becomes no-longer-inside-them, they take to a sleep they do not awaken from. What wonders await these eternal dreamers? You kneel and hold his hand one last time then turn and begin the journey home. Rest in peace brother – we will remember your flame when the darkness closes in.</p>

<p>From <del>playing with</del> investigating the bodies, we discovered <code>Ammonia</code> and used our resources to build <code>The Leatherworker</code>.

<p>After many hours of introspection and discussion the settlement comes to a consensus. We have decided that we are not about weak-ass wimpy bitch-babies and chose the hard-knock path of <code>Survival of the Fittest</code> – offspring are much less likely to make it through rearing within the settlement, but those that survive to adulthood are better prepared to endure the harshness of the waste. Armed with the confidence only foreknowledge of <em>superior buff babies</em> can bring, our heros set out and slew a <code>White Lion</code> while barely breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>Night became day. A blinding flash turned the world to white. Permanently, for one unlucky scout who had been looking in the eldritch ordinance’s direction. A couple more had been awake: the first had insomnia and was grinding away the hours making meal from various vermin gathered and preserved over the years and he said everywhere became so bright so quickly that he didn’t have time to shield his eyes and had spots in his vision for weeks after. The second, the town’s eccentric chemist, ran outside carrying a hammered piece of metal that had been laying near his desk, which moments earlier had had a bottle of volatile cyanoplatinate analogues (unbeknownst of course to our town’s <em>shaman</em>, but he’s doing his best, can’t be too hard him). The plate held a ghostly yet distinguishable imprint of the chemist’s own hand. Without the skin. Mostly the outline of the bones to be precise.</p>
<p>“I have seen my own death!” he shrieked melodramatically.</p>
<p>This world was obviously no stranger to deranged black swan events showing up willy-nilly and causing god knows what mayhem. The light had initially dimmed away, almost impossible to see, before slowly building in intensity until unknown leagues away a vertical shaft of chaotic energy split the sky in two. At whatever could be considered the “peak” of the line of light – it was hard to crane one’s neck far back enough to make out too much detail – one could see the light open up into a contained spherical shape, which would periodically writhe and pulse, leaving fading slashes of darkness against the glowing exterior. We prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>Hot damn! We are blessed! Blessed by holy lights in the sky! sacred <code>lifetime rerolls</code> were exchanged for a bounty of 3 beautiful buff babies!</p>

<p>“Holy light homiieessss.

<p>Confidence begets the fall.</p>
<p>In our case – narrowly-begets-the-fall.</p>
<p>As we prepared for what we thought would be another lion hunt, someone noticed a light began pulsing in the distance. A faint metallic sound begin to build as the settlers felt resonance vibrations begin to rhythmically form in their chest. In concert with this beast’s footsteps no doubt. The pulse of the light was a dim lantern that periodically swung behind the bulk of the shape forming through the mist. We could only watch in horror as an enormous armored hulk sauntered towards their home. We could smell him before we could fully see his visage in the flickering light he held. Why was the light so dim? A question many wished had never been answered.</p>

<p>Evident from the stretched caricature of human faces adorning the monster’s lantern, he was not here to parlay. Ordinary survivors may have wet their filthy rags – we on the other hand, hatched a devious plan.

Baited into a blind fury, <code>The Butcher</code> ran towards us but his devastating movements only made contact a single time before he lay still upon the barren stone.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the blow that fell him separated <code>The Butcher's Cleaver</code> – usually welded in place – from his armored gauntlet and the settlement gained a powerful talisman to use against the coming darkness.</p>

<p>One enterprising villager – a missed opportunity as an inevitable arsonist if there <em>were</em> much to burn around here – had noticed how the heat and glow of the fire pulsed in concert with the eerie wind that would sometimes ebb and flow through the settlement. Using some tattered strips of hide and bone scraps he formed an air proof sack he could run holding above his head and swing down to trap the air. By squeezing the top of the bag in his fist and holding the bag beneath his arm, he could simultaneously squeeze and relax his grip to spew a concentrated column of air into the fire.</p>
<p>The forge was born.</p>
<p>Another became so entranced by the dancing flame before them that they plunged their hands deep into the scalding embers as others could only watch and gasp. Incredulously they watched as the madman removed their hands, not unscathed, but not mangled and charred. Burnt, but glowing with a dangerous power – the rapturous <code>Hands of Heat</code>. The survivors had forged minds of steel and swiftly dealt with a Lion despite the depravity they had witnessed earlier.</p>

<p>Horror, these settlers of The Mind had become inured to. But… Absurdity? Insanity? These were novel frontiers to conquer. First, reports of a prancing band of weirdos on the outskirts of town are heard before one morning an enormous statue of a – one might say oddly handsome <code>Lion Knight</code> with beautiful hair – except for the fact that from each finger extended a 12” razor sharp blade. Something about the statue was so unnerving that despite the theoretic ability to use the blades attached to the statue in some manner, it was topic that never made its way from thought to discourse.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the other reports were utterances far more unsettling. People reported seeing an inhumanly tall, gangly, and stark pale figure standing partially behind a tree, bush, or corner of a building. Upon doing a double-take this apparition would vanish – a mere trick of the light? If the reports had not been collected independently, it would be nothing to worry about… Whispers of the <code>Slenderman</code> were heard, but never in polite company.</p>

<p>As the villagers began the arduous task of collectively picking up their jaws, a vibrant rainbow shuddered over the settlement. Several retched during the nauseating distortions that rippled as the silhouette of an enormous distorted bird appeared dimly in the sky above. The granularity of the effects were not noticed immediately, but the spacetime scars that had appeared briefly in the settlement had the incredibly unfortunate effect of transposing a highly effective growth gene into a benign bacterial colony in the left lower lung of one villager. Coughs turned to wheezes turned to water out the ass as the settlers quickly donned makeshift masks and hunkered in their respective enclaves to wait out the infection.</p>
<p>The hunt was a breeze thanks to <strong>Emily Dickinson</strong>, who showed the settlement was more than capable of taking on the more dangerous species of <code>White Lion</code> they had found existed a few years back. The lion was no match for the hunters’ ferocity and <strong>Emily</strong> cleaved the lion’s jaw from his face as she slay him.</p>

<p>The woman awoke exasperated. How her husband’s stomach be growling <em>so loud</em> to wake her in the middle of the night! Yes, it wasn’t always easy having filling meals on the table but she knew he had eaten enough. As the bed started to shake and the rumbling grew louder she began to suspect the source of the noise was different than she had presumed. The husband woke as the shaking intensified, knocking items off and with a jolt the woman toppled backwards and the man was thrown into the side of the wall. As the woman sat up she saw her husband’s head silhouetted against an ominous and somehow <em>thick</em> green glow from somewhere distant outside. Was this an omen from the gods? They would have to be careful if they chose to seek the origin of the glow. Hm, maybe there are some “volunteers” around here we could encourage…</p>

<p>The ferocity of the glowing crater smashing mercilessly into the ground was indeed an omen – and a metaphor – for the hale, handsome, and oh-so-virile <strong>Adam Smith</strong>. It turns out one person was taking <em>very</em> careful notes during that first eventful fucking and the settlement welcomed three hearty and insane babies into this dark dark world, one without even a semblance of nations, let alone ones possessing any wealth. These cold truths aside, a celebration was in order!</p>
<p>…And you wouldn’t be so rude as to fail to deliver an invitation to your settlement’s own patient guest of honor, would you?</p>
<p>Possibly besmirched by this lack of invitation, who’s to say, the previously immobile statue of the <code>Lion Knight</code> roared to life and joined in on the festivities…ferociously!</p>
<p><strong>Euler’s</strong> back was destroyed in the ensuing chaos and moments before the rest of him could join the obliteration, <strong>Sir David Attenborough</strong> (sorry – been a busy year, but he’s a knight now, don’t worry it’ll be in the Christmas card) dealt the killing blow and was awarded with the perfect way to obscure his grotesqueries – <code>The Hideous Disguise</code>.</p>

<p>Our good friend uh…whatever his name used to be was visited by a hooded stranger who placed <code>The Twilight Sword</code> into his hands and left without uttering a single word. Befitting his settlement’s name, he chose to bravely wield it in battle against the very next <code>Antelope</code> they saw and promptly had his head trampled in. Oops.</p>
<p><strong>Milton Friedman</strong> decapitated the <code>Antelope</code> with a critical hit in revenge. After the fight the others went over to the trampled remains to look for <code>The Twilight Sword</code> but when pulled the fabric covering his body away they were struck by a bizarre sight. The fabled <strong>Argyle</strong> – He Who Transcends – lay before us covered head-to-toe in translucent moths. The moths formed a murmuration and swelled and shrank chaotically as they flew away.</p>
<p>Oh right and then on the walk home <strong>Argyle</strong> got possessed during a haunting. It was a busy year, what can I say.</p>

<p>As the celebrations died down a cold and unusual wind blew through the camp and the settlers hearts stilled as the many lantern flames dimmed and whimpered. The settlers watched as the sky cracked with lightning – trumpeting the arrival of <code>The King's</code> most venerated and dangerous servant.</p>
<p>Appearing a short distance from the haze, smoke, and stone ash that swirled around the locus of the lightning strike that had cracked apart the marble faces, a tall and impressively armored… thing stood, facing the distant mountains. What looked to be a golden crown adorning his head was open to the night’s breeze, with deep cuts along the side exposing the bloodless and bloated twisting worms that comprised the thing’s brain.</p>
<p>His body remained perfectly still as his head suddenly snapped sideways to face us. The force of this look alone caused more than one to stumble backwards. His head remained perfectly in position as the rest of his body smoothly rotated to join his facing orientation.</p>
<p>Only a madman or something far worse and likely far, <em>far</em> more dangerous, could stroll with such contemptuous leisure into this place.</p>
<p>Several paces away he came to a sudden and immediate halt.</p>
<p>A piece of falling ash left a grey tear-like streak along its cheek as it danced to gravity’s yearning call.</p>
<p>He stood there for what felt like a silent eternity then tilted his head very slightly back and forth to one side in a sort of random walk – as if attuning himself to a frequency only he could hear.</p>

<p>On the bright side, we had four fewer mouths to feed that year. Not that it changed much, we were still going to need food and supplies for the year. <strong>Jane Goodall</strong> flexed her impressively defined biceps and easily brought down an <code>Antelope</code> with the aid of a few other survivors and we set to work preparing for the year ahead.</p>

<p>A rare gift indeed. A quiet year spent in contemplation. As impossible as it would once seem some things are now unequivocally “routine”.</p>
<p>As a child she had watched the embers dance and twirl above the fire every night – mesmerized by the endless interplay of shape and shadow that appeared in what felt like the deepest part of her being. An amorphous thought bulged and gnarled – contours split along its surface as the sodium cascade pounded against it.</p>
<p>A sharp blade, a steady hand, an endless river of determination. The woman cut sheets of fascia and tissue so thin she could see every vein running along her hand beneath. She formed a thin cord from light-weight fibers found by splitting a type of stiff weed that tufted out from beneath cracks in the stone ground.</p>
<p>She breathed life into her creation.</p>
<p>The גּוֹלֶם awoke and its birth cry pushed hotly against the cold air. The skein grew taught along the surface and the already miniscule weight in the woman’s hand eased as the balloon slowly and beautifully began to float into the night’s sky. The woman smiled as her shoulders began to shake and she fell to her knees in quiet exaltation as tears cut their meandering desire paths into the dirt and grim of her weathered face.</p>

On their first venture out for the <code>Gigalion</code>, <strong>Steve Irwin</strong> spotted an out-of-place statues and upon touching it immediately glowed with a sheen from the others’ lantern light – he had turned to stone. The settlers swung their lanterns and stumbled back in surprise as the statue <strong>Steve</strong> had been inspecting was gone and in its place stood a man. And not just any man. A pathetic man. One who exuded what could only be bizarrely yet accurately described as a “palpably greasy aura”. One who also looked <em>very much</em> like the statue that had been there before. He stood there and yawned. “Well, uh, bummer about your friend there. They call me <strong>Lord Kelvin</strong>, what are we up to?”</p>
<p>The settlers sighed.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t shut up either and kept bothering the others to play a word game to pass the time.

<p>A hush fell over the village as news of the Butcher’s return spread like wildfire. He was a formidable foe, a towering monstrosity with horns and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The mere mention of his name sent shivers down the spines of even the most hardened hunters. But we were not ones to back down from a challenge, no matter how daunting.</p>
<p>David Attenborough, our resident naturalist, had been given permanent priority in recognition of his invaluable contributions to the community. Armed with a sharpened spear and his extensive knowledge of the Butcher’s behavior, he set out to face the beast head-on. The battle was intense and bloody, with David barely surviving several close encounters with the monster’s claws and teeth. But in the end, he emerged victorious, his spear buried deep in the Butcher’s heart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Margaret Howe had triggered the death blow that allowed us to obtain the Forsaken Mask, a powerful relic that would enable us to construct the Mask Maker. It was a risky move, but Margaret had always been a gambler at heart. She had a knack for rolling high when it mattered most, and this time was no exception.</p>
<p>As for Jane Goodall, she had inherited the Twilight Sword, a legendary weapon that had been passed down through the generations. With it, she gained two proficiency levels in swordplay, becoming an even deadlier warrior than before. It was said that the sword had a will of its own, and that it chose its wielder based on some mysterious criteria known only to itself.</p>
<p>But even with these powerful tools at our disposal, we knew that the real battle was yet to come. The Butcher was just the first of many challenges we would face in our quest for survival. The future was uncertain, and the odds were against us. But we were a resilient people, and we would not be broken so easily. We would fight tooth and nail for every scrap of food, every drop of water, every inch of land. And in the end, we would emerge victorious, or die trying.</p>

<p>The final fight with the Lion Knight (for reference, he shows up as a statue one night and comes to life occasionally to fight you with a shakespearan air of murder). Leveraging the <code>Quad Strike</code> tactic, the fight started off quite well but Lion Knight’s incredible speed quickly became na issue. Even with a gloomperson and our savior Jane Goodall, Jane was sliced and diced until she bled to death. Gloomperson was MVP, avoiding almost all damage and then Sir David Attenborough shot his spicy Gloom-coated Arrow, blowing him to smithereens despite his single leg, broken other leg, and torn achilles tendon. Sir David became a bow master and margaret howe became a katar master. Full of optimism, they ventured out to fight the phoenix. A scary and treacherous fight, but they are triumphant once again.</p>

<p>The Lion Knight stood towering above the settlement, an imposing figure made all the more frightening by the way he seemed to materialize out of nowhere. It was a cold and foggy night, perfect for the Lion Knight’s theatrics. As the hunters approached, the statue came to life with a flourish of its cape and a flourish of its weapon, eager to do battle.</p>
<p>The first few strikes went well, as the hunters employed the “Quad Strike” tactic to great effect. But as the fight wore on, the Lion Knight’s incredible speed began to take its toll. Even with the help of the gloomperson and the formidable Jane Goodall, the hunters were starting to lose ground. And then, tragedy struck.</p>
<p>Jane was caught off guard and the Lion Knight’s sword sliced her open, leaving her to bleed out on the battlefield. The hunters rallied around her, but it seemed like all was lost. That is, until the gloomperson stepped up and became the MVP of the fight, avoiding almost all of the Lion Knight’s attacks and giving the hunters the opportunity they needed.</p>
<p>And then, in a stroke of genius, Sir David Attenborough pulled out his spicy Gloom-coated Arrow and took aim at the Lion Knight’s single leg. The arrow hit true, and the Lion Knight tumbled to the ground with a sickening thud. With its other leg broken and its achilles tendon torn, the Lion Knight was no match for the hunters. Sir David Attenborough became a bow master that day, and Margaret Howe became a katar master, their skills honed in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Buoyed by their success, the hunters turned their attention to the phoenix. It was a treacherous fight, fraught with danger at every turn. But the hunters were triumphant once again, their optimism and determination seeing them through to victory.</p>
<p>As they returned to the settlement, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. They had faced down the Lion Knight and emerged victorious. They had battled the phoenix and lived to tell the tale. Who knew what other challenges awaited them in the years to come, but they were ready for anything.</p>

<p>The air was thick with the pungent smell of smoke and ash as the survivors trudged wearily back to their settlement. Their faces were streaked with sweat and soot, their bodies battered and bruised from the relentless onslaught of the Gigalion. Hedy Lamar, the once-meek survivor who had transformed into a fierce warrior, was leading the charge. She held the Lion Knight’s claws aloft, the weapons still dripping with the blood of their defeated foe.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin Attenborough, the settlement’s resident expert on all things biological and botanical, was grinning from ear to ear. “I told you, didn’t I?” he exclaimed. “I knew that Hedy was the one who could take down that beast!”</p>
<p>Hedy’s chest heaved with exertion, but she managed a small smile. “It was a close call,” she said, wiping the sweat from her brow. “But we did it. We really did it.”</p>
<p>The survivors had spent months preparing for this fight. They had crafted the finest armor and weapons, studied the Gigalion’s every move, and trained relentlessly to be able to take it down. And now, after a grueling battle, they had emerged victorious.</p>
<p>But the triumph was short-lived. As they made their way back to the settlement, they could see smoke rising in the distance. Their hearts sank as they realized that their home was under attack. They quickened their pace, their weapons at the ready.</p>
<p>As they approached, they saw that the settlement was under siege by a pack of snarling Goblins. The creatures were small, but they were fast and deadly. The survivors knew that they had to act quickly if they wanted to save their home.</p>
<p>Hedy led the charge, her Lion Knight claws flashing in the sunlight as she sliced through the Goblin ranks. Sir David Attenborough was right behind her, his bow singing as he picked off the creatures from a distance. Margaret Howe was close behind, her Katar blades flashing in the sunlight.</p>
<p>The battle was fierce and intense, but the survivors fought with a ferocity born of desperation. They knew that their lives and their home were on the line. And in the end, they emerged victorious once again.</p>
<p>As the last of the Goblins fell, the survivors took a moment to catch their breath. They looked around at the smoldering ruins of their settlement, and then at each other. They knew that they had been through hell and back, but they had come out stronger for it.</p>
<p>And as they stood there, battered and bruised but unbowed, they knew that they were ready for whatever the world threw at them next.</p>

<p>What better way to celebrate stephen kings favorite number than a triathlon of death! Hedy lamar won the foot race, willa cather won the debate contest, and fight contest, and charles sucks at fighting and got his arm cut off like an idiot. Unfortunately, an eerie presence has returned… the slenderman’s terrifying visage threatens the settlement once more. He murdered 4 people. Thankfully it was all just a bad dream. Learning from this gristly premonition, the survivors plan better and sent out Margaret howe who proceeded to beat the shit out of him. Slenderman attempted to ensnare twice but was met with two perfect lanterns. Milton Friedman Smith narrowly escaped death by rolling to perfect lanterns on their trauma roll. Hit the death blow and left with 3 dark water!</p>

<p>As the settlement basked in the afterglow of their triathlon of death victory, they were quickly reminded that darkness still loomed on the horizon. The return of Slenderman was not taken lightly by the survivors, and they knew they had to be prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Margaret Howe was ready to take on the challenge. Armed with her katars and fierce determination, she charged headlong into the fight. Slenderman proved to be a formidable opponent, but Margaret was up to the task. She dodged his attempts to ensnare her and landed blow after blow with her deadly weapons.</p>
<p>The rest of the settlement watched in awe as Margaret expertly fought the terrifying creature. And when Slenderman attempted to ensnare her a second time, she was ready with two perfect lanterns, shattering his hold and leaving him vulnerable to her attacks.</p>
<p>Despite a near-death experience for Milton Friedman Smith, who narrowly avoided death thanks to his quick reflexes, the survivors emerged victorious. Slenderman was vanquished, and the settlement was left with three precious dark waters as a reward for their efforts.</p>
<p>But they knew that this was only the beginning. With darkness still lurking just beyond the horizon, they would need to stay vigilant and continue to hone their skills if they hoped to survive. For in this world of death and danger, only the strong and the cunning will endure.</p>

<p>As the settlement’s gears were turning towards building up their armor and weaponry, a strange feeling began to permeate the air. It was as if an unknown force was watching their every move. The survivors felt a sense of unease and paranoia, causing them to constantly look over their shoulders.</p>
<p>The unsettling sensation only grew stronger when they discovered a note left by an unknown entity, written in an unfamiliar language. While the message’s meaning was unclear, it was evident that it wasn’t a friendly one. As they tried to decipher the message, they couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched.</p>
<p>Despite their apprehension, the survivors knew they had to keep moving forward. Margaret Howe, armed with the hooded knight’s sword, led a team to hunt the elusive and deadly Phoenix. The battle was fierce and intense, but with Howe’s leadership and the team’s unwavering determination, they emerged victorious.</p>
<p>However, their celebration was short-lived. The hooded knight’s sword began to pulsate and emit a strange energy, causing Howe to feel a sudden sense of dread. The sword had become cursed, and it seemed as though the hooded knight’s dark legacy had returned to haunt them.</p>
<p>As the survivors grappled with the implications of the cursed sword, they noticed that the feeling of being watched had not dissipated. In fact, it only seemed to have grown stronger. They knew they had to be vigilant and prepared for whatever lay ahead, for they were being watched by something much more ominous than they had ever encountered before.</p>

In search of some deadly arrows, the group sets out to fight the gigalion. After surviving a mudslide, they find a nice pool of cledar water which turns hedy and willa’s hair stark white. Margaret howe got her 2nd twilight sword proficiency. With their hearty haul, the sruvivors build a Blacksmirth to create the Dense Bone Arrows.</p>

<p>While I understand the deeply unsettling nature of AI, automation, and vast potential for artist abuse, it provided me an opportunity to explore visual media in a way I would not be able to otherwise given my technical limitations within the area. I spent thousands of hours practicing to be a mediocre tech death drummer and several thousand other hours wasted in grad school, not learning to draw. Tools like stable diffusion allow me to combine visual art with the other thing in life I truly enjoy: swearing at the computer and package dependency hell.</p>
<p>I think of an interview many years ago with Hans Zimmer that surprised me. He said he wasn’t really “fluent” in any particular instrument and that he is appreciative music made its way onto computers or he would never have had the opportunity to explore a passion that brings him and many others so much joy.</p>

<p>Many illustrations are derived <em>directly</em> from the <a href="https://build.kingdomdeath.com/">Kingdom Death</a> miniatures themselves. <code>ControlNet</code> provides an incredible starting point given a desired structural composition within the image. The <code>depth</code> and <code>lineart</code> models within ControlNet are my general go-to choices but I experimented with almost all of the useful ones.</p>
