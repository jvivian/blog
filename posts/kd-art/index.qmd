I made most of this artwork about ~8-9 months ago as part of an amateur writing series which I've written ~20 chapters of (out of 30) but only released the [prologue](https://github.com/jvivian/blog/tree/main/posts/kd-awake).

Many illustrations are derived *directly* from the [Kingdom Death](https://build.kingdomdeath.com/) miniatures themselves (see @sec-mini) using `ControlNet` within Stable Diffusion. I most often used the `depth`, `lineart`, and `softedge` models within ControlNet as my starting point.

Artwork I created for each chapter. One per "year" in our Kingdom Death campaign. Each piece is titled after its respective chapter. Year 7 is missing because that is when the White Speaker arrived (if you've played you understand).

Below are all examples where the actual miniature from Kingdom Death itself was used as the basis for building the artwork, typically via `ControlNet`.

## An editorial the author wrote to make himself feel better
All art was created using a computer, several dozen pieces of software, and several hundred more hours than expected.

While I understand the deeply unsettling nature of AI, automation, and vast potential for artist abuse, these tools provided me an opportunity to explore visual media in a way I would not be able to otherwise given my technical limitations within the area. I have spent thousands of hours practicing to be a mediocre tech death drummer and several thousand other hours wasted in grad school, not learning to draw. Tools like stable diffusion allow me to combine visual art with the other thing in life I truly enjoy: swearing at the computer and package dependency hell.

I think of an interview many years ago with Hans Zimmer that surprised me. He said he wasn't really "fluent" in any particular instrument and that he is appreciative music made its way onto computers or he would never have had the opportunity to explore a passion that brings him and many others so much joy.
