## Nanopore reread project

![**A**: Substrate bound to the lipid bilayer via a cholesterol tag with a helicase (Hel308) bound and inactive at the other end. **B**: Electric potential causes the DNA duplex to unwind, leaving behind the cholesterol tether bound to the complement strand. **C**: Electric potential and the steady-state nature of the G-Quadruplex (GQ) causes it to unfold allowing the helicase to become enzymatically active in the 3’ -> 5’ direction. **D**: As Hel308 translocates the DNA back up through the pore, the GQ will refold allowing an additional enzyme to become bound. **E**: Continued translocation. **F**: More than 3-4 abasic residues causes Hel308 to dissociate from the substrate (9 are used in the substrate). The DNA strand is then pulled back down and the cycle is able to repeat itself once more.](imgs/nanopore_figure.png){width=100%}

Tracks show tissue-specific expression of two genes from the GTEx dataset<br>

:::{.callout-note}
TCAP, known as the titin cap protein, is predominantly expressed in muscle tissue. On the other hand, PP1R1B, which is a potential therapeutic target for neurological disorders, is expressed in the brain's basal ganglia but not in muscle or brain cortex

33 samples and 5 tissues displayed out of 7,304 samples and 53 tissues<br>

The tracks for hg19 were produced using the UCSC liftOver tool, which converts coordinates from hg38 bedGraph files created by STAR2 within the Toil pipeline

::: {.notes}
- Mention also collaborating with a researcher on the UCSC genome browser team and contributing all GTEx RNA-seq tracks to the genome browser

::: {.notes}
- Mention collaborating closely with protein engineering to design, maintain, improve tools they used every day
- Ab-CRUNCH
    - Annotated reports of antibody sequences, metadata, chain sequences, multiple alignments, and more
    - 200 antibodies took 45 - 60 minutes to process, after I rewrote it from scratch I reduced the codebase by 66% and 200 antibodies could be processed and returned in about a minute.
