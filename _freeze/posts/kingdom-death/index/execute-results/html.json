I was immediately entranced and stunned to find out this story was based on video game, one with _emergent gameplay_ which meant the incredible tale had not been explicitly hard-coded. It was from a game I was surprised I had never heard about called `Dwarf Fortress`\n\n\"Surely this must be the greatest game ever made! I must immediately find and play it!\"\n\n![13 year old me: \"What the fuck is this?\"](imgs/dorfs.png)\n\nMy tiny child mind was too stupid to handle ASCII graphics so I never even attempted to play the game, but I never forgot how incredible it was to read about such a ludicrous adventure that somehow made me care about these dwarves being hurt or dying while doing whatever it is dwarves do. Mining and drinking mostly.\n\n20 years later, after a [Kingdom Death](https://kingdomdeath.com/) campaign where I doodled some random pictures and notes from the campaign, I had the idea to take a set of more detailed notes for the next campaign and compile it into a short little summary to share with the others as a going away gift when they moved later this year. 2-3 pages tops.\n\nThen, in the middle of the campaign, I had the idea to use Midjourney, a text-to-image generation tool my wife had shown me, to make maybe 2-3 cool pictures I could include with the summary of the campaign. That would really step it up a notch.\n\nI ended up working on this, in some capacity, every day for almost three months. I got obsessed with new features in tools like Stable Diffusion, which offer much more control than commercial tools like Midjourney, and seemed to come out every day. As my friend joked, \"Honey! New ControlNet just dropped!\" I ended up spending hours each week making and learning about digital art. Hundreds of hours later I'm happy with the progress I've made and how much fun I've had doing things like mocking up one of my favorite guitarist's Chaos Nurgle kitbash model: @sec-mp-nurg.\n\n![And now for something, completely different](imgs/misc/p01gk35d.jpg)\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Prologue Warning\nThe prologue is written in a drastically different style from the rest of the work -- which is still gruesome but humorous. By contrast, the prologue is inspired by one of my favorite hard sci-fi books _Blindsight_ by Peter Watts, whose narrative style invokes confusion and uses abstract imagery.\n\nThe prologue can be skipped by jumping to @sec-y1\n:::\n\n\n## $\\infty$ : Awake {#sec-y0}\n\n> Cogito, ergo sum\n\n<center>Darkness</center><br>\n\n<center>Cold</center>\n\n---\n\n<center>Pain</center><br>\n\n<center>Light</center>\n\n---\n\n<center>You</center><br>\n\n<center>Awake</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n…and prop yourself up on the hard, damp surface beneath you. Something… something _feels_ wrong. Hands move instinctively -- cautiously probing for the intrusion at the behest of one subroutine that, task complete, falls back among billions of writhing kin that labor within the emergent cathedral formed from an uncountable array of taut chromatic threads. They murmur indecipherably, weaving a Rorschach loom deep into the static hum of an endless sprawling labyrinth below. Hands clench in concert -- knuckles forming in flight -- and begin the labor of rubbing away the thick, pitch-like sap that blinds you from the world. The darkness shudders and a horizon ruptures forth -- spilling uncalibrated brilliance onto a virgin charcoal canvas -- as the first photons smash uncaringly into their hibernating lover’s perfect grasping hands, hewn by millennia to receive them. Black jaws squeal momentarily then snap shut to ward off the spreading incandescent rot. Hands return once more, their work unfinished. As the knuckles knead and grind, countless phosphenes spawn, dance vibrantly, and die. A horizontal crack tentatively forms anew, flutters briefly in resistance, and then _opens_…\n\n…to a sea of dark marble stone faces that extend out in all directions from the ashen and cracked ground below. Each face etched within the marble earth is unique, and your eyes lap greedily at the novel stimuli before the well quickly runs dry against a dark fading haze extending in all directions. Lethargic pulses and chaotic flickers of light sing out to one another from their perches within several dozen tarnished and heavy-looking lanterns that lie scattered haphazardly around you. Flames courageously slash and gouge impotent scars against the gloom’s surface before being quickly subsumed within its boundless polyphagic maw. The distant horizon bleeds pitifully into the twilight above. Glancing upward you subconsciously seek a constant engrained within the germ of your genetic lineage. You feel a deep pit of unease and confusion -- _It is not there_. You lean forward -- eyes strain their fibrous bridles, but find no purchase for the seam that separates one part of the formless space before you from another. Vertigo briefly sets in as your mind slowly begins to sink into the infinite sprawling vacuum. Discordance evokes a primal Stygian dread as sensory perception comes to conflict with _that which is known_. \n\nThe umbral space before you begins to st r _e &nbsp; &nbsp;t &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h_ <br>\n\n:::{.column-screen}\n![](imgs/ch00a-wide.jpg){group=\"gallery\"}\n:::\n\nThe low roar of an ocean fills your ears as the dull hammering beat of your heart grows louder, deafening you, stifling the chorus of pleas from reactive counter-measures as signal decays into a rising static tide. Glossolalia drips mercury-hot across your skin as the indiscernible cicadic chatter of a million voices rave the clarion call of the insane. Of _Machin Shin_, The Black Wind. The beckoning void reaches out to you, enveloping you, all-encompassing, all-consumi-<br><br><br>\n\n<center>Motion</center><br>\n\nResponse <br>\n&emsp; &emsp; Potential<br> \n&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Engagement<br> \n&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Magnocellular Exultation<br><br>\n\n<center>_A rapidly expanding undifferentiated web of light_</center><br>\n\nPerturbations in the periphery of your visual field scream out along ancient intention lines below to an older paranoid sibling who awakens with a slumbering roar, deafening the babble of the memetic death-spiral feedback loop within the cerebrum. The voices spiral out in chaotic gyres, growing dimmer as they lose coherence and scatter harmlessly upon the bone-dry wind.\n\nYour head snaps quickly to focus on this disturbance and you see others -- like yourself -- spread out in the murk, sitting up, looking around, rubbing dark ink from their eyes. A few huddle together, one helping another to his feet. Your meandering eyes halt abruptly -- pools of dark ink sloshing quietly against another -- as you stare directly into the eyes of one sitting away from the others and closer to you. His gaze narrows briefly but quickly relaxes upon seeing your open expression. A moment passes. Small pockets depress the contours of his cheeks and the corners of his mouth turn upwards into a hesitant smile. Reflexively, your eyes move downwards in response, and, in transit, a saccadic mask deceives you and they arrive at their destination empty-handed. The lack of concordance between expectation and reality takes a fraction of a second to materialize.\n\nA thin dark liquid spurts in a double exposure across the fading face you had glimpsed. Time slows in unison with the fluid’s passage, which pauses briefly at the peak of its lazy parabolic arc, and turns with a sigh to await the fall. An abyssal seed soars unimpeded into this plane on eldritch wind, takes root, germinates, and begins to bloom deep within. Your chest heaves against its newfound prison, your breath becoming ragged and uneven. Hyperventilation sets in as consciousness attempts to parse the frantic, abstract imagery of the subconscious.\n\nThe headless torso slumps forward, slamming violently down -- pinned crudely into the chiseled ground by an enormous _human-like_ hand. Viscera oozes between the White Lion’s dexterous fingers -- a simulacrum of rotten human fruit. He has come to feast. Muscles rippling, eyes glinting with dangerous intelligence, it pivots smoothly towards another, who had only just begun rubbing the ink from his eyes, deftly cradling one hand around its prey's face, another enclosing still-rubbing arms, and with unnecessary glee, sharply jerks the head off. The White Lion stands on hind legs and bellows -- delighting in the ecstasy afforded apex predators -- and begins the slaughter.\n\n![](imgs/ch00b-white-lion-better.jpg)\n\nYour unconscious backpedaling meets temporary resistance as you stumble into three others -- the same ones you had seen together earlier -- who embrace you in their trembling bosom of arms and rags to cower behind a meager shield of inadequate cover among a few torso-sized boulders. A hollow serenity fills you as the gore and carnage of the beast become a mere visual and auditory display, safely compartmentalized from the screaming and panicked signaling of other neural systems.\n\nYou look at the others, who paint a shifting scene of anguish, panic, and despair. You turn instinctively towards the others and lock eyes -- you have no language with which to comfort one another. But what comfort is there in certain death? One who had been rocking back and forth on the ground with their arms around their knees slowly rises to their feet clutching something with white-knuckled hands. She opens them stiffly to reveal a bloodied shard of stone, taken from one of the fractured stone faces beneath them where the lion had first announced his presence.\n\nHope in the face of hopelessness.\n\nYou lock eyes with the others and your steeled gazes cut the Gordian knot. The scope and profundity of the absurd reality before you clarifies. What choice is there but to fight? To cower before death’s gaze is to diminish the spirit -- far better to look it in the eye and shout defiantly. For there is hope where there is courage. You and the other two quickly take to the ground, scrounging for similar tools with which to arm yourselves. As you stand you suddenly realize the shocking stillness of the quiet around you.\n\nNo others remain but you and your meager cohort. And the White Lion, of course. He sits patiently several stones’ throws away, as if waiting for you to wake from your reverie and acknowledge the reality of the situation before its termination. A cruel sadism that seems unnecessary for fitness -- but perhaps prolonging execution constitutes a form of bootstrapping when training the networks responsible for hunting, stalking, and killing prey.\n\nThe lion stands, pauses for a moment to sniff the air cautiously, then charges.\n\nEpinephrine and norepinephrine flood your body, causing muscles to tense, mouth to dry, eyes to dilate, and your mind to clear. The lion seems to slow as each breath becomes loud in your ears. As the lion prepares to pounce he is startled by your looks of calm resolve and stutters in an attempt to abort. A demented cackle cuts through the air -- you are unsure whether you or your peers are the origin.\n\nYou and the others lift the shards above your head and scream as you sprint with abandon towards the confused beast. Enthralled with such bestial triumph there is no room for petty thoughts of mortality. There is only room for glory. Only room for victory.\n\nThe world is a series of flashes, screams, roars, pain, and rage as you and the three others mercilessly stab the White Lion as it backpedals, slashing impotently, unable to adequately defend itself on all sides.\n\nA woman, who holds no name as there is yet no language, seizes an opportunity as the lion limps weakly, blood leaking from myriad gashes and cuts in its flanks, and places the mortal blow. As the lion rears up on hind legs to bat away another attacker, the muscles in her arm ripple and time slows, the stone shard spinning end-over-end, until it collides with the lion’s groin -- obliterating its genitals completely.\n\n---\n\nAs the dust settles and quiet returns, you and the others shatter the stillness with elated bellows and sapien ululations, embracing one another, jumping and whooping with unrestrained joy. Together you proceed to harvest several juicy spherical bits from the lion, use your sharpened stones to crudely hack away his once prideful mane, and set off together in search of shelter. For if the White Lion could survive here -- at least for a time -- so could they.\n\nAfter an indeterminate period, you see a faint glow in the distance that continues to grow in the dark fog as your group moves closer. Emboldened -- and without much choice -- you proceed towards it and gasp along with the others when a towering stack of lanterns whose thin climbing peak seems to defy intuitive physics materializes out of the haze. Shapes move in the darkness and a familiar icy fear reaches up quickly to embrace you. But…\n\n…they are like you.\n\nThey pause cautiously and then notice your rags, shaking hands clutching shattered stone shards. One shouts excitedly to the others, rapidly joining together a series of confusing and challenging syllables, pointing to the lion’s mane wrapped around _She-Who-Slayed-Him_. The same one steps out towards the others slowly and lowers a much more impressively crafted bone knife to the ground and then raises his hands towards you. You look to the others, who imperceptibly nod, and you slowly bend to set your stone shards on the ground and begin awkwardly walking over together. As you step closer you see there are only six people in total and, as your eyes take in each unique face, the look of hope at your arrival is palpable. You are needed here. \n\nYou are welcome here.<br><br>\n\n<center>You are home</center>\n<br>\n\n\n## Year 1: Returning Survivors {#sec-y1}\n\n> Legs blown off, all hope is lost<br>\nA human life is what it cost<br>\nOthers follow close behind<br>\nA real adventure they will find \n\n<br><br>\n_scritch_, _scratch_\n<br>\n\nWell, it's not the _worst_ job in the settlement. And I can write about pretty much anything and it looks like I'm diligently working. \n\nHeh, ok -- maybe not so bad. _Curator of the Historical Documents_ has a nice ring to it. Too bad that's not my title and nobody will call me that, but hey -- something to work towards. Goals! People are supposed to have those -- right?\n\nWith so many ~~weirdos~~ brilliant minds about it's not too surprising to see an exponential uptick in technological innovations. A `Symposium` to display new inventions and discuss outlandish ideas was built in the square beneath the looming `Lantern Hoard`, sparking much joy. As we set out on the year's hunt to gather necessary resources, the ground erupted beneath us and we plunged into the sky on the back of an impossibly large stone beast -- as if riding atop the very land itself. We scuttled along its lengthy back struggling to gain purchase and somewhere closer to the titan's head we were struck by the sight of a ghastly pale miniscule creature with an inverted stone face -- with what appeared to be carving tools in hand. Upon cresting the spine the creature was nowhere to be seen, but we did find 4 additional founding stones to add to our persons. Looking about we saw perfectly carves faces adjacent to a set cracked and weathered by the volatile weather and... well.. big moving mountains apparently.\n\nWe were confident from our first victory, but this `White Lion` did not go down without leaving his mark. Our dear **Ptolemy** -- whose ink stills stains your thumb from the moment you rubbed it from his eye and beheld another human's gaze for the first time -- had his legs forcibly and -- rather unpleasantly -- separated from his torso. It is obvious even if he lived we would have struggled to bring him home, but this confirms what we had universally suspected -- if enough of the red liquid inside someone becomes no-longer-inside-them, they take to a sleep they do not awaken from. What wonders await these eternal dreamers? You kneel and hold his hand one last time then turn and begin the journey home. Rest in peace brother -- we will remember your flame when the darkness closes in.\n\n☠️ **Ptolemy**\n\n![](imgs/ch01.png){group=\"gallery\"}\n\n## Year 2: Endless Screams\n\n> I didn't choose to be of this Earth <br>\nI didn't choose this Human Burden\n\nFucking. _Seemed_ like fun, but wow. That did _not_ go well. Two denizens of the **Settlement Intelligencia** fucked so poorly they somehow died. Maybe all that damn screaming had something to do with it. It's been difficult to get a good night's sleep in weeks -- the screaming was difficult to ignore as sometimes it went on for what seemed like hours. \n\nFrom ~~playing with~~ investigating the bodies, we discovered `Ammonia` and used our resources to build `The Leatherworker`. After an intense discussion about what exactly went wrong with the first fucking, a second fucking commenced which was incredibly successful: yielding a pair of healthy twins. \n\n<!-- ![](imgs/ch02.png) -->\n![](imgs/ch02-endless-screams-4k.jpg){group=\"gallery\"}\n\nAfter many hours of introspection and discussion the settlement comes to a consensus. We have decided that we are not about weak-ass wimpy bitch-babies and chose the hard-knock path of `Survival of the Fittest` -- offspring are much less likely to make it through rearing within the settlement, but those that survive to adulthood are better prepared to endure the harshness of the waste. Armed with the confidence only foreknowledge of _superior buff babies_ can bring, our heros set out and slew a `White Lion` while barely breaking a sweat.\n\n\n## Year 3: Lights in The Sky\n\n> All at once, the Lights! <br>\nCarried from a distance, Shot to me, <br>\nFlowing through me, Flashing before me, <br>\nViolent, Convulsing, Bright <br>\nI was haggard but unworn, <br>\nI was youthful but bitter, <br>\nI was ignorant, I was worldly, <br>\nI was shown into a lifetime's experiences\n\nNight became day. A blinding flash turned the world to white. Permanently, for one unlucky scout who had been looking in the eldritch ordinance's direction. A couple more had been awake: the first had insomnia and was grinding away the hours making meal from various vermin gathered and preserved over the years and he said everywhere became so bright so quickly that he didn't have time to shield his eyes and had spots in his vision for weeks after. The second, the town's eccentric chemist, ran outside carrying a hammered piece of metal that had been laying near his desk, which moments earlier had had a bottle of volatile cyanoplatinate analogues (unbeknownst of course to our town's _shaman_, but he's doing his best, can't be too hard him). The plate held a ghostly yet distinguishable imprint of the chemist's own hand. Without the skin. Mostly the outline of the bones to be precise. \n\n\"I have seen my own death!\" he shrieked melodramatically.\n\nThis world was obviously no stranger to deranged black swan events showing up willy-nilly and causing god knows what mayhem. The light had initially dimmed away, almost impossible to see, before slowly building in intensity until unknown leagues away a vertical shaft of chaotic energy split the sky in two. At whatever could be considered the \"peak\" of the line of light -- it was hard to crane one's neck far back enough to make out too much detail -- one could see the light open up into a contained spherical shape, which would periodically writhe and pulse, leaving fading slashes of darkness against the glowing exterior. We prepared for the worst.\n\nHot damn! We are blessed! Blessed by holy lights in the sky! sacred `lifetime rerolls` were exchanged for a bounty of 3 beautiful buff babies! \n\n![](imgs/lights-in-the-sky.jpg){group='gallery'}\n\n\"Holy light homiieessss. Let's roll baby!\" yelled the overeager leader of the hunting party, who to be fair, _was_ impressively pulling off a series of phantom karate moves against an invisible foe -- complete with accompanied sound effects -- all while maintaining a steady jog ahead of the other three. They didn't mind. Why? Have... have you been reading? Buff Babies! Get your shit together.\n\nAnyway, back to the lion. Long story short: he should have been scared of _us_.\n\n## Year 4: The Butcher\n> A voiceless choir weeping<br>\nContorted bodies stacking<br>\nThe dull hum of death<br>\nDeafening\n\nConfidence begets the fall. \n\nIn our case -- narrowly-begets-the-fall.\n\nAs we prepared for what we thought would be another lion hunt, someone noticed a light began pulsing in the distance. A faint metallic sound begin to build as the settlers felt resonance vibrations begin to rhythmically form in their chest. In concert with this beast's footsteps no doubt. The pulse of the light was a dim lantern that periodically swung behind the bulk of the shape forming through the mist. We could only watch in horror as an enormous armored hulk sauntered towards their home. We could smell him before we could fully see his visage in the flickering light he held. Why was the light so dim? A question many wished had never been answered. \n\n`The Butcher` had arrived.\n\n:::{.column-screen-inset-shaded}\n![](imgs/The-Butcher-4k.jpg){group='gallery'}\n:::\n\nEvident from the stretched caricature of human faces adorning the monster's lantern, he was not here to parlay. Ordinary survivors may have wet their filthy rags -- we on the other hand, hatched a devious plan. Starting in the corner of the open battlefield we sprang into action! -- Swiftly dealing three wounds with our freshly carved founding stones. Baited into a blind fury, `The Butcher` ran towards us but his devastating movements only made contact a single time before he lay still upon the barren stone.\n\nIncredibly, the blow that fell him separated `The Butcher's Cleaver` -- usually welded in place -- from his armored gauntlet and the settlement gained a powerful talisman to use against the coming darkness.\n\n## Year 5: Hands of Heat & Murder\n> Brother are you here, hiding<br>\nIn the mist<br>\nHiding in fear<br>\nRegurgitate<br>\nRelease\n\n\n**Galileo**, overwrought with jealousy, murdered the legendary **Jane Austen** in cold blood. As if that were not heinous enough, he then proceeded to painstakingly _devour_ her skull. Smashing it against the stone faces to form pieces small enough to hungrily push down his gullet. \n\n![](imgs/ch05-b.png){group='gallery'}\n\nOne enterprising villager -- a missed opportunity as an inevitable arsonist if there _were_ much to burn around here -- had noticed how the heat and glow of the fire pulsed in concert with the eerie wind that would sometimes ebb and flow through the settlement. Using some tattered strips of hide and bone scraps he formed an air proof sack he could run holding above his head and swing down to trap the air. By squeezing the top of the bag in his fist and holding the bag beneath his arm, he could simultaneously squeeze and relax his grip to spew a concentrated column of air into the fire. \n\nThe forge was born. \n\nAnother became so entranced by the dancing flame before them that they plunged their hands deep into the scalding embers as others could only watch and gasp. Incredulously they watched as the madman removed their hands, not unscathed, but not mangled and charred. Burnt, but glowing with a dangerous power -- the rapturous `Hands of Heat`. The survivors had forged minds of steel and swiftly dealt with a Lion despite the depravity they had witnessed earlier.\n\n_ever forwards..._\n\n☠️ **Jane Austen**\n\n## Year 6: Uninvited Guest \n> I blinked and saw nothing <br>\nI blinked and saw a struggle between embers <br>\nI blinked and saw a face <br>\nI blinked and saw a face <br>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the Dark\n\n\nHorror, these settlers of The Mind had become inured to. But... Absurdity? Insanity? These were novel frontiers to conquer. First, reports of a prancing band of weirdos on the outskirts of town are heard before one morning an enormous statue of a -- one might say oddly handsome `Lion Knight` with beautiful hair -- except for the fact that from each finger extended a 12\" razor sharp blade. Something about the statue was so unnerving that despite the theoretic ability to use the blades attached to the statue in some manner, it was topic that never made its way from thought to discourse.\n\nConcurrent with the other reports were utterances far more unsettling. People reported seeing an inhumanly tall, gangly, and stark pale figure standing partially behind a tree, bush, or corner of a building. Upon doing a double-take this apparition would vanish -- a mere trick of the light? If the reports had not been collected independently, it would be nothing to worry about... Whispers of the `Slenderman` were heard, but never in polite company.\n\n![](imgs/ch06.png){group='gallery'}\n\nHe... he's so familiar. Everyone agrees they know who he is -- and he acknowledges that he has known them for some time -- but the man formerly known as **Galileo Figaro** -- ceased to possess name known by any member of the collective. Unsettling indeed...\n\nThe charming **David Attenborough** journeyed out for the first time. In what was later agreed by all to be a rather fair exchange as far as these things go, David Attenborough had his leg cut off by the lion, and in return cut the lion's hand off and grew stronger from the experience.\n\n🦵 **David Attenborough**\n\n## Year 7: Phoenix Feather & Plague\n\n> Them Thangs be Thangin'\n\nA mysterious and scantily clad blind woman strolled into the settlement. I uh... I don't really remember what she wanted or asked about. \n\nWhat? Stop looking at me like that.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## An impeccable rendition confiscated from a youth. Best kept from prying eyes...\n\nCouldn't help yourself could ya?\n\n![](imgs/White-Speaker.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n## A somehow _even more_ lascivious rendition!?\n\n![BONK! Gotcha 😏](imgs/bonk.jpg)\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nAs the villagers began the arduous task of collectively picking up their jaws, a vibrant rainbow shuddered over the settlement. Several retched during the nauseating distortions that rippled as the silhouette of an enormous distorted bird appeared dimly in the sky above. The granularity of the effects were not noticed immediately, but the spacetime scars that had appeared briefly in the settlement had the incredibly unfortunate effect of transposing a highly effective growth gene into a benign bacterial colony in the left lower lung of one villager. Coughs turned to wheezes turned to water out the ass as the settlers quickly donned makeshift masks and hunkered in their respective enclaves to wait out the infection.\n\nThe hunt was a breeze thanks to **Emily Dickinson**, who showed the settlement was more than capable of taking on the more dangerous species of `White Lion` they had found existed a few years back. The lion was no match for the hunters' ferocity and **Emily** cleaved the lion's jaw from his face as she slay him.\n\n## Year 8: Glowing Crater & Rumbling in the Dark\n> There's a place within the mind<br>\ncolored splendor there, you'll remember where<br>\nA scene where beauty used to shine<br>\nnever yours or mine, faded, broken lines<br>\nOnly traces are left behind<br>\nSorry, silent stares, breathing poisoned air<br>\nChildren shrieking towards the sky<br>\nHatred they declare, and they care not where\n\nThe woman awoke exasperated. How her husband's stomach be growling _so loud_ to wake her in the middle of the night! Yes, it wasn't always easy having filling meals on the table but she knew he had eaten enough. As the bed started to shake and the rumbling grew louder she began to suspect the source of the noise was different than she had presumed. The husband woke as the shaking intensified, knocking items off and with a jolt the woman toppled backwards and the man was thrown into the side of the wall. As the woman sat up she saw her husband's head silhouetted against an ominous and somehow _thick_ green glow from somewhere distant outside. Was this an omen from the gods? They would have to be careful if they chose to seek the origin of the glow. Hm, maybe there are some \"volunteers\" around here we could encourage...\n\n![](imgs/ch08.png){group='gallery'}\n\nThe ferocity of the glowing crater smashing mercilessly into the ground was indeed an omen -- and a metaphor -- for the hale, handsome, and oh-so-virile **Adam Smith**. It turns out one person was taking _very_ careful notes during that first eventful fucking and the settlement welcomed three hearty and insane babies into this dark dark world, one without even a semblance of nations, let alone ones possessing any wealth. These cold truths aside, a celebration was in order!\n\n...And you wouldn't be so rude as to fail to deliver an invitation to your settlement's own patient guest of honor, would you? \n\nPossibly besmirched by this lack of invitation, who's to say, the previously immobile statue of the `Lion Knight` roared to life and joined in on the festivities...ferociously! \n\n**Euler's** back was destroyed in the ensuing chaos and moments before the rest of him could join the obliteration, **Sir David Attenborough** (sorry -- been a busy year, but he's a knight now, don't worry it'll be in the Christmas card) dealt the killing blow and was awarded with the perfect way to obscure his grotesqueries -- `The Hideous Disguise`.\n\n\n## Year 9: Forgotten Fear\n> This is but one woven world<br>\nwithin a medley of revulsion<br>\nA scope unfathomable to the conscious mind<br>\nEaten, Willow…<br>\nVines tore me off my feet<br>\nand under the water again\n\n\n**Emily Dickinson** was always a bit of an odd bird that one, so I guess it makes sense that she would become `The Gloom Woman` carrying the `Husk of Destiny`. A terrifying combination and one the `Slenderman` was not prepared for in the slightest. **Emily Dickinson** popped `Slenderman's` like a fermented pomegranate then promptly forgot her name.\n\n![](imgs/ch09.png){group='gallery'}\n\nOur good friend uh...whatever his name used to be was visited by a hooded stranger who placed `The Twilight Sword` into his hands and left without uttering a single word. Befitting his settlement's name, he chose to bravely wield it in battle against the very next `Antelope` they saw and promptly had his head trampled in. Oops.\n\n**Milton Friedman** decapitated the `Antelope` with a critical hit in revenge. After the fight the others went over to the trampled remains to look for `The Twilight Sword` but when pulled the fabric covering his body away they were struck by a bizarre sight. The fabled **Argyle** -- He Who Transcends -- lay before us covered head-to-toe in translucent moths. The moths formed a murmuration and swelled and shrank chaotically as they flew away. \n\nOh right and then on the walk home **Argyle** got possessed during a haunting.

The settlement even crafted a set of potent `Gloom-coated Arrows` to make this venture even more pedestrian.\n\nYou know what else is pedestrian?\n\n...\n\nWalking into traffic.\n\n![](imgs/ch10.png){group='gallery'}\n\n**Vera Rubin** had her head repeatedly trampled until it would be difficult to say that what remained was even capable of being trampled further. \n\n**Janet Yellen-Smith** was bitten to death. \n\n**Rebecca Smith** had her chest caved in. \n\nUntil only sweet sweet **Argyle** -- He Who Transcends -- remained. The repeated nicks and cuts the `Antelope` delivered as it shot back and forth across the chipped and mangled field of stone faces was finally too much for our hero to bear. His breathing labored and his movements slowed. He quietly lay down his tenacious dough-kneading arms and sighed in exsanguination. \n\n☠️ **Vera Rubin** <br>\n☠️ **Janet Yellen-Smith** <br>\n☠️ **Rebecca Smith** <br>\n☠️ **Argyle** <br>\n\n## 10 Years: A Summary\n\n| Year | Monster     | Level | Special Showdown | Level | Deaths |\n|------|-------------|-------|------------------|-------|--------|\n| 0    | White Lion  | 0     | -                | -     | 1      |\n| 1    | White Lion  | 1     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 2    | White Lion  | 1     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 3    | White Lion  | 1     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 4    | The Butcher | 1     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 5    | White Lion  | 1     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 6    | White Lion  | 2     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 7    | White Lion  | 2     | -                | -     | 0      |\n| 8    | White Lion  | 2     | Lion Knight      | 1     | 0      |\n| 9    | Antelope    | 2     | Slenderman       | 1     | 2      |\n| 10   | Antelope    | 2     | -                | -     | 4      |\n\n\n## Year 11: Regal Visit\n> The rusted chains of prison moons <br>\nAre shattered by the sun<br>\nI walk a road, horizons change<br>\nThe tournament's begun<br>\nThe purple piper plays his tune <br>\nThe choir softly sing<br>\nThree lullabies in an ancient tongue<br>\nFor the court of the Crimson King\n\nA dark day indeed -- but one reclaimed by copious face-paint and fornication! A savior is born to **Sir David Attenborough** and **Amelia Earhart** as well as a pair of twins! \n\nAs the celebrations died down a cold and unusual wind blew through the camp and the settlers hearts stilled as the many lantern flames dimmed and whimpered. The settlers watched as the sky cracked with lightning -- trumpeting the arrival of `The King's` most venerated and dangerous servant. \n\nAppearing a short distance from the haze, smoke, and stone ash that swirled around the locus of the lightning strike that had cracked apart the marble faces, a tall and impressively armored... thing stood, facing the distant mountains. What looked to be a golden crown adorning his head was open to the night's breeze, with deep cuts along the side exposing the bloodless and bloated twisting worms that comprised the thing's brain.\n\nHis body remained perfectly still as his head suddenly snapped sideways to face us. The force of this look alone caused more than one to stumble backwards. His  head remained perfectly in position as the rest of his body smoothly rotated to join his facing orientation.\n\nOnly a madman or something far worse and likely far, _far_ more dangerous, could stroll with such contemptuous leisure into this place. \n\nSeveral paces away he came to a sudden and immediate halt.\n\nA piece of falling ash left a grey tear-like streak along its cheek as it danced to gravity's yearning call. \n\nHe stood there for what felt like a silent eternity then tilted his head very slightly back and forth to one side in a sort of random walk -- as if attuning himself to a frequency only he could hear. \n\n:::{.column-screen-inset-shaded}\n![](imgs/the_hand.jpg){group=\"gallery\"}\n:::\n\nHis head froze for a moment then slowly straightened -- almost visibly locking into a perfectly upright position and a smirking grin split his face. \n\nShit. This was going to hurt.\n\nThree were struck down in the charade of a fight that ensued and as a final mockery `The Hand` off-handedly (ha! ha.. ok sorry won't happen again) smote our comrade **Karl Marx**. Then casually meandered away, enveloped by the shadow.\n\nOn the bright side, we had four fewer mouths to feed that year. Not that it changed much, we were still going to need food and supplies for the year. **Jane Goodall** flexed her impressively defined biceps and easily brought down an `Antelope` with the aid of a few other survivors and we set to work preparing for the year ahead.\n\n☠️ **Karl Marx** <br>\n☠️☠️☠️  **~~Greg?~~\"Blood Bags\"** \n\n## Year 12: Hooded Knight & Lanterns in the Sky\n\n> To everything, there is a season <br>\nAnd a time to every purpose, under heaven <br>\nA time to be born, a time to die <br>\nA time to plant, a time to reap <br>\nA time to kill, a time to heal <br>\nA time to laugh, a time to weep\n\nA rare gift indeed. A quiet year spent in contemplation. As impossible as it would once seem some things are now unequivocally \"routine\". \n\nAs a child she had watched the embers dance and twirl above the fire every night -- mesmerized by the endless interplay of shape and shadow that appeared in what felt like the deepest part of her being. An amorphous thought bulged and gnarled -- contours split along its surface as the sodium cascade pounded against it.\n\nA sharp blade, a steady hand, an endless river of determination. The woman cut sheets of fascia and tissue so thin she could see every vein running along her hand beneath. She formed a thin cord from light-weight fibers found by splitting a type of stiff weed that tufted out from beneath cracks in the stone ground.\n\nShe breathed life into her creation.\n\nThe גּוֹלֶם awoke and its birth cry pushed hotly against the cold air. The skein grew taught along the surface and the already miniscule weight in the woman's hand eased as the balloon slowly and beautifully began to float into the night's sky. The woman smiled as her shoulders began to shake and she fell to her knees in quiet exaltation as tears cut their meandering desire paths into the dirt and grim of her weathered face.\n\nWe cheered and sang and roared against the night sky. \n\n![](imgs/ch12.png){group='gallery'}\n\nTo whatever panoply of cruel and capricious gods who lurk high above this kingdom of death, let this be our herald. \n\nWe are here. \n\nPray some catastrophe befall us before we discover the means to join our lanterns above.\n\nFor we will not be merciful.\n\nThe distant glow of the lantern hoard came sharply into focus as the hunters crested a hill carrying their haul from a fresh `Lion` kill -- minds steeled for whatever unnameable terrors await.\n\n## Year 13: The Lion, The Hand, & The Silver City\n\n> Do not cite the deep magic to me Witch <br>\nI was there when it was written\n\n![](imgs/ch13-b.png){group='gallery'}\n\n\"Welcome friend! Good thing you found us, quite an exciting time indeed. Hm? Him? Oh, well there's just one of him and we have three other strapping new recruits like yourself to aid you. It will be fine!\"\n\nIt wasn't fine.\n\nAs is usually the case, things could have been much worse. All four ~~blood ba~~ new friends impressively survived `The Hand`'s performative beatdown. As is his nature, two were slain by `The Hand` on his exit from the settlement -- obviously annoyed with the settlement's unwillingness to \"play.\" Eat shit you tin can weeaboo.\n\nBefore the shallow graves could be dug, the `Lion Knight` awoke to continue the revelry. **Sir David Attenborough** filled the role of Cupid and shot a Clawhead arrow straight into his heart knocking him to the stone ground. **Margaret Howe** and **Amelia Earhart** then proceeded to beat the absolute shit out of this wannabe theatre kid furry. Using some `Gloom-coated Arrow` trickery, a special `death blow` was delivered by **Sir David Attenborough** who, by wearing the `Hideous Disguise`, became an `Ageless Apprentice`. \n\n\nThe settlement proceeded to mourn the loss of their two new friends with a rowdy celebration that left the settlement with four glorious new spartan children to take up the mantle.\n\n## Year 14: $10^9$ Lion\n> The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens<br>\nA depth perception languished in the night<br>\nAll my life I've been sowing the wounds<br>\nBut the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud\n\nDuring their quiet year of research and planning, the settlement confirmed that a rumored variant of the `White Lion` -- the girthy `Gigalion` -- roamed within hunting range of the settlement. On their first venture out for the `Gigalion`, **Steve Irwin** spotted an out-of-place statues and upon touching it immediately glowed with a sheen from the others' lantern light -- he had turned to stone. The settlers swung their lanterns and stumbled back in surprise as the statue **Steve** had been inspecting was gone and in its place stood a man. And not just any man. A pathetic man. One who exuded what could only be bizarrely yet accurately described as a \"palpably greasy aura\". One who also looked _very much_ like the statue that had been there before. He stood there and yawned. \"Well, uh, bummer about your friend there. They call me **Lord Kelvin**, what are we up to?\"\n\n\nThe settlers sighed.\n\nHe wouldn't shut up either and kept bothering the others to play a word game to pass the time. Shortly after beginning -- and shortly after a heated dispute -- the party's raucous arguing alerted the `Gigalion` to their presence who prepared an ambush. Chuckling to himself, one might think, if within his strange and twisted intellectual capacity.\n\n![](imgs/ch14.png){group='gallery'}\n\n**Neils Bohr** swaggered out to meet the `Gigalion`, confidence in his step -- as if this were just another same-old-same-old `White Lion`. A few meaty smacks and some ill-luck later, his head exploded in an impressive shower of gore. Infuriated at this turn of events -- for **Neils** owed several of them money -- the remaining survivors cornered the `Gigalion` and took out their frustrations swiftly and brutally.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## STORY IS UNFINISHED UP TO THIS POINT\n\nI decided to release a version now because the writing part is slow for me and if I waited until the entire thing were done I'd be an old man\n:::\n\n## Year 15: (B) The Decade of Statues\n> Brood over fallen empires<br>\nThat were built upon the bones of millions<br>\nRegression to the mean<br>\nRepression of the weak<br>\n$$Z=\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\bar{X}_n-\\mu}{\\sigma_\\bar{X}}$$\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Raw text\n\nOn the hunt for the `Phoenix`, Lord Kelvin \"\"accidentally\" bumped into the statue and brought back Steve Irwin.

Even with a gloomperson and our savior Jane Goodall, Jane was sliced and diced until she bled to death. Gloomperson was MVP, avoiding almost all damage and then Sir David Attenborough shot his spicy Gloom-coated Arrow, blowing him to smithereens despite his single leg, broken other leg, and torn achilles tendon.

I spent thousands of hours practicing to be a mediocre tech death drummer and several thousand other hours wasted in grad school, not learning to draw. Tools like stable diffusion allow me to combine visual art with the other thing in life I truly enjoy: swearing at the computer and package dependency hell. \n\nI think of an interview many years ago with Hans Zimmer that surprised me. He said he wasn't really \"fluent\" in any particular instrument and that he is appreciative music made its way onto computers or he would never have had the opportunity to explore a passion that brings him and many others so much joy. \n:::\n\nMany illustrations are derived _directly_ from the [Kingdom Death](https://build.kingdomdeath.com/) miniatures themselves. `ControlNet` provides an incredible starting point given a desired structural composition within the image. The `depth` and `lineart` models within ControlNet are my general go-to choices but I experimented with almost all of the useful ones. \n\n\n::: {.grid}\n::: {.g-col-6}\n![Lion Knight
